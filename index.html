  ................isn't what this world teaches you it is. This world doesn't know LOVE. This world tries to prop up its own version of LOVE but it is so far from the TRUTH, it brings death. Real LOVE isn't what you think it is. LOVE isn't a feeling. LOVE isn't comfort. LOVE isn't your definition of LOVE that you happen to prefer today. No, LOVE is truth. The LOVE I'm talking about, the LOVE I'm after, the LOVE I know, the LOVE running the whole dang show - the real kind of LOVE, the kind of LOVE that turns you into a completely new person when you understand it kind of LOVE. The LOVE that LOVES its hateful, lost creation so much that it DIES for it and then comes to LIFE again because LOVE is too powerful for death to ever win. The type of LOVE I'm talking about is WAY TOO BIG for this sorry world, much less the screen you're reading this on. The only worthy, everlasting LIFE, closer than close LOVE in which all things consist, the devastatingly powerful LOVE by which all things were created - by Him AND for Him, because He <b>is</b> LOVE...No, not the false love that is preparing to deceive the lost and that the world preaches constantly like it even knows what real LOVE is - and real LOVE is nothing short of the ALMIGHTY CREATOR of THE HEAVEN and THE EARTH, THE FIRST AND THE LAST, THE BEGINNING AND THE END, THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA, THE ETERNAL I AM...blessed and hallowed and holy be His name forever!
  </i>
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>Don't you want this awesome LOVE? Because it's yours. I'm here to remind you how it's always been yours for the taking. According to your faith in Jesus Christ and His words, it could be yours forever.</p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>Ahhh, but people don't believe, so they don't get to take any of it! They settle for the false love taught and preached and lived and shown in this world, a love so twisted that when you compare it to the LOVE of the HEAVENLY FATHER, the love of this world is plain <i>evil</i>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOesPUXJxtc" target="_blank">Wake up, you sinful and lost and spiritually blind world! If you don't think you need Jesus, you REALLY need Jesus!</a>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>I LOVE you with the same veracity that the Creator LOVES!</p>
  <p>So know that I want what is best for you, because your Creator wants what is best for you!</p>
  <p>He wrote a book lining out what it means to love well and live well, to be good and to be blessed!</p>
  <p>And that's all I want for you reading this right now. I want you to have the best life you can have!</p>
  <p>And I promise you brother, I promise you sister, that is only found by you <i>fully</i> trusting in the truth - Jesus Christ and His words!</p>
  <p>Read on for more truth!</p>
  <p>And if it sounds harsh, that's because the truth cuts deep and is real to ears that have been raised by lies!</p>
  <p>And we have all been raised by lies because we have been raised by this horribly lost and broken world!</p>
  <p>But the Lord came to fix those that love not the brokenness and want to truly be fixed!!!</p>
  <p>The Lord says what He says because He LOVES you!</p>
  <p>And He wants you to listen to Him because He knows what is best for you!</p>
  <p>But what happens? The human heart cooks up evil, and something tells it to not trust the Lord and His words!</p>
  <p>Why? Because Satan - the enemy of God AND the enemy of YOU - has probably lulled your ears to sleep - putting a spell on any holes in your faith so that you don't believe in Jesus nor the Bible!</p>
  <p>And if you don't believe in Jesus and what He did for you and how much He loves you...</p>
  <p>...Then why would you obey His voice and listen to Him and do what He commands?...</p>
  <p>So brother, so sister, I pray you turn to Jesus Christ and the Holy Bible and <i>trust every word</i>.</p>
  <p>Because the Lord is on your side...if you are with Him!</p>
  <p>But we are raised in a world that is against Him!</p>
  <p>So to be with the Lord, you must hate this world!</p>
  <p>Because this world is only about hiding the truth - the righteousness of life with Christ...</p>
  <p>Because this world only cooks up lies to deceive you and deter you and to diminish your everlasting joy...</p>
  <p>Because the power behind this world knows that when you turn to Jesus Christ...</p>
  <p>When you get saved and born again with the Holy Spirit...</p>
  <p>The enemy has lost your soul and your soul was gained by the Lord!</p>
  <p>Because after you get saved, now you have died to yourself, and are alive in Jesus Christ!</p>
  <p>He is your God and He is your Shepherd and He is your rock!</p>
  <p>And He will lead you to walk in His ways which will always be righteous and lead to eternal life!</p>
  <p>How amazing is that? The love that the Lord has for those that believe in Him...it's amazing...</p>
  <p>So whoever you are reading this...just know that Jesus loves you...</p>
  <p>And He is calling you to live an eternal life with Him!</p>
  <p>To become born again and live for Him and His kingdom!</p>
  <p>And only then will your soul have the freedom and joy and peace that it longs for!</p>
  <p>Because we were made to dwell with Him! With Jesus!</p>
  <p>So get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbb4xwYj19g" target="_blank"><b>saved</b></a> and join the family!</p>
  <p>The eternal family of God is eagerly longing for you to become a member forever!</p>
  <p>Soon Jesus will call His family home!</p>
  <p>So I pray you get saved and I hope to see you soon!</p>
  <p>***</p>
  <p>But of course, at the end of the day, it's up to you.</p>
  <p>This world has a deceptive allure to the flesh and many people fall prey to it.</p>
  <p>I urge you to read until the end, and know that the Lord is screaming for you and He has been screaming at you since He created you - with His creation, with the people He has placed in your life, and most of all, with His holy written word!</p>
  <p>So trust in Him and you will be under His good graces forever!</p>
  <p>***</p>
  <p>But continue to deny Him and continue to live in ignorance and sin...</p>
  <p>And unfortunately for you your days are numbered...</p>
  <p>Because to be with God forever you must be born again! You must repent of your sins and your sinful ways! And you must trust in His blood to cover all your iniquity!</p>
  <p>Otherwise, a perfect and holy and righteous God will be judging your life!</p>
  <p>And none of us will stand the judgment unless we have the Word of God to cover us!</p>
  <p>I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!</p>

  <p>I say everything here with as much love as anyone could ever have.</p>
  <p><i>If you don't remember having the following conversation with your Creator, you have the most <h1>serious</h1> case of amnesia.</i></p>
  <p>And if you don't remember why you're here...</p>
  <p><i>you're probably going to perish just like your Creator warned you.</i></p>
  <p>Don't waste your breath complaining to me or anyone else. In the end, unless you have Jesus Christ as your personal lawyer - and He has always been willing to take on as many cases that people give Him - it will be your own life that condemns you. Your Creator gave you everything you ever had and a whole lifetime to turn to Him for salvation. But, unless you are born again and have accepted His gracious gift of eternal life through the righteous blood of Yeshua, you never <i>truly</i> wanted Him. Your perfect Creator made you. And then you willingly rebelled against Him, turning your back on Him and walking off. And then, after that, out of His great love for you, He ran after you and DIED. FOR. YOU. So that you could have the opportunity to turn back to Him and come back home to where you were created to be. You were never created to be apart from Him, which is where you are now if you don't know Him. But it's not up to Him anymore because He already pursued you fervently and laid His life down for yours. And so by your own living and by your heart's most high desire - your life will be a perfect testimony either for you or against you.
  </p>
  <p>If you want, choose the truth then. Choose life. Repent of your rebellion and run back into the arms of your Heavenly Father who is eager for your return.</p>
  <p>But don't expect to be forgiven for rejecting Him first and living life on your own terms...and on top of that, now rejecting His literal sacrifice for you and refusing to change in light of how much He gave for you and how much He loves you.</p>
  <p>Our life is a reflection of what we want. We all do what we most want to do.</p>
  <p>So, what did you do with your life? What did you want?</p>
  <p>What are you doing with your life now? What are you wanting <i>really</i>?</p>
  <p>A quick look at your life will be the perfect testimony either for you, if you turned to Jesus and repented of your ways and sought righteousness and kept His commandments - loving YaH well...</p>
  <p>Or it will be the perfect testimony against you, if you went through life numbing yourself with vanity and distraction and drunkenness, reveling in the temporary but costly bliss of your wickedness...</p>
  <p>Did you pursue life and good, or death and evil?</p>
  <p>The Lord warned us all what happens to people who pursue life and good and what happens to people who pursue death and evil...</p>
  <p>Because the Lord is a perfect God! And so to be with Him, it requires perfection!</p>
  <p>But none of us are perfect! None of us are enough to be with Him! So what happens is He knows this and so sets up a perfect system whereby He will come on the earth in the form of a man and be the perfect sacrifice - He will die the death that all sinners deserve!</p>
  <p>And those that really want life and goodness, they find Jesus Christ and they believe Him because He is the truth! He really is the Lord in the flesh who died for you and me...all so that we could live with Him and by Him and for Him some day!</p>
  <p>And that day is really soon! So come to Jesus, my friend, run from death and evil, and love the righteousness of life!</p>
  <p>And the righteousness of life is none other than Jesus Christ himself!</p>
  <br />

  <p><u>Deuteronomy 30:15-20</u></p>
  <p><b>See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;</p>
  <p>In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.</p>
  <h1>But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;</h1>
  <h1>I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish,</h1>
  <p>and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.</p>
  <p>I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:</p>
  <p>That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.</p>

  <p>Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. <h1>But they said, "We will not hearken."</h1></p>
  <p>Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.</p>
  <h1>Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.</h1>

  <p><u>Jeremiah 7:19</u></p>
  <h1><b>Do they provoke me to anger? saith the Lord: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?</h1>
  <p>Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the gorund; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</p>
  <p>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.</p>
  <p>For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:</p>
  <p>But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.</p>
  <h1>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.</h1>
  <h1>Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:</h1>
  <h1>Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.</h1>
  <h1>Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.</h1>
  <p>But thou shalt say unto them,</p>
    <h1>This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.</h1>

  <p><u>1 Corinthians 15:34-58</u></p>
  <p><b>Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.</p>
  <p>But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</p>
  <p>Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:</p>
  <p>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:</p>
  <p>But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</p>
  <p>All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.</p>
  <p>There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.</p>
  <p>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.</p>
  <p>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</p>
  <p>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</p>
  <p>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</p>
  <p>And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.</p>
  <p>Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</p>
  <h4>The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</h4>
  <h4>As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</h4>
  <h4>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</h4>
  <h4>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</h4>
  <h3>Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</h3>
  <h3>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</h3>
  <h3>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</h3>
  <h3>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</h3>
  <h1>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</h1>
  <h4>The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</h4>
  <h2>But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</h2>
  <h2>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</h2>

  <p><u>Luke 17:25</u></p>
  <p><b>But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.</p>
  <p>And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</p>
  <h1>They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</h1>
  <h1>Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</h1>
  <h1>But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.</h1>
  <p>Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</p>
  <p>In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</p>
  <p>Remember Lot's wife.</p>
  <p>Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</p>
  <p>I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one house; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</p>
  <p>Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>
  <p>Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>
  <p>And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.</p>

  <p>I had a lot to say, and I thought it of the most importance.</p>
  <p>Because what I had to say shined light on how you, the reader, may have true, everlasting life according to your faith.</p>
  <p>So beyond our imagination of what good is.</p>
  <p>And I wanted everyone to have true, righteous, everlasting life - I still do.</p>
  <p>But the real tragedy going on here is that not everybody wants that.</p>
  <p>For if someone <i>actually</i> wanted the truth...</p>
  <p>...then they would find it.</p>
  <p>***</p>
  <p>My poem gave glory to how you will conquer death.</p>
  <p>(And all who know YHUShA will soon indeed conquer death, despite disbelief on all sides.)</p>
  <p>It was a long love letter to all my fellow people.</p>
  <p>A declaration of my love for them.</p>
  <p>It was everything I could do to get them to see who I see coming so soon.</p>
  <p>And so it was nothing.</p>
  <p>Because they didn't want Him to come.</p>
  <p>Surely - and I mean - surely - they had better things to do...</p>
  <p>They didn't want to see Him in the first place.</p>
  <p>So how could I have expected them to understand the implications of my words?</p>
  <p>***</p>
  <p>I walked the duty of an author - I spilled my heart's blood for the sake of the best story.</p>
  <p>But I'm just a man.</p>
  <p>And my blood is worthless.</p>
  <p>***</p>
  <p>I suppose our fate is sealed by what our heart wants most.</p>
  <p>What we all want - surely - is the good life.</p>
  <p>But if you don't know what's <i>truly</i> good...</p>
  <p>And if you don't know what the <i>true</i> source of life is...</p>
  <p>You're not gonna find the <i>real</i> good life.</p>
  <p>So pray you don't go barking up the wrong tree, lest you die.</p>
  <p>***</p>
  <p>All the answers you are looking for are found between the covers of the Holy Bible.</p>
  <p>There you will see how the blood of your Creator was spilled for YOU.</p>
  <p>There you will find how this world and everyone in it are doomed unless they get born again of the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p>There you will see how they weren't kidding when they said

  </p>
  <p>The end of days was declared from the beginning and all of it is found between those covers.</p>
  <p>The same words which have the key to unlock the mystery of both you and the world you are imprisoned in.</p>
  <p>The most well known book in this world...prophesies the same world's destruction.</p>
  <p>But people have been tricked into not listening. A dark spell is what fills their ears, twisting and distorting and keeping them deaf to the truth.</p>
  <p>If you love this world, and have anything but the truth as the center of your being, you have been terribly deceived.</p>
  <p>And are in the process of being destroyed.</p>
  <p>It's simple. If you're not living right, you're dying.</p>
  <p>And we only have the power to live right if the Spirit of Yeshua dwells within us.</p>
  <p>Amen.</p>
  <p>***</p>
  <p>If you want to not go down with the ship, if you love truth, if you love what is good, if you are willing to go all in for the living YaH, then you will find YHUShA.</p>
  <p>And He will save you from both yourself and this world.</p>
  <p>And He will guard you from the false messiah that will soon appear on the world stage who will truly deceive this lost world and all those who are lost in it. And He will sustain you from receiving the mark of the beast and eternal damnation. And He will pour truth upon truth into your being and everlasting joy and peace of God shall be yours. As much as you believe Him, of course.</p>
  <p>So <i>believe</i> Him and all that He says and does.</p>
  <p>And it <i>will</i> be well with you.</p>
  <p>He is always faithful.</p>

  <p>He <i>is</i> the King of kings.</p>
  <p>And He <i>is</i> the Lord of lords.</p>
  <p>And He <b><i>will</i></b> reign forever and ever.</p>

  <h1>I KNOW IT'S HARD TO HEAR ME THROUGH ALL THE WATER</h1>
  <h1>YOU ARE DROWNING, YA HEAR ME?</h1>
  <h1>YOU ARE IN A SPIRITUAL TRAP, A WHIRLPOOL OF SENSELESS MOVEMENTS ENDING IN DEATH</h1>
  <h1>TOTALLY LOST IN THE JUNGLE</h1>
  <h1>VANITY OF VANITIES</h1>
  <h1>UNTIL YOU ARE FOUND</h1>
  <h1>YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE OR <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZgzTlqB23A">WHY YOU ARE HERE</a></h1>
  <h1>YOU ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF REDEMPTION!</h1>
  <h1>IF YOU DO NOT BECOME SINCERELY REDEEMED...</h1>
  <h1>THEN YOU WILL BE...</h1>
  <h1>ETERNALLY.</h1>
<h1>SEPARATED.</h1>
<h1>FROM THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY WHO HOLDS EVERY GOOD THING...</h1>
<h1>JESUS CAME TO SAVE YOU AND GIVE YOU LIFE</h1>
<h1>BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW HIM</h1>
<h1>YOU ARE ALREADY DEAD</h1>
<h1>GET TO KNOW THE TRUTH WHILE YOU ARE ABLE TO</h1>
<h1>TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD GOD</h1>
<h1>GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU</h1>

<p>***</p>
  <p>I'm presenting all of this before you so that you might be saved by believing in Jesus and having His blood cover you and your iniquity, so that you too may inherit eternal life and be with God.</p>
  <p>***</p>
  <p>If <i>you</i> WANT the truth - if you GENUINELY WANT THE AUTHENTIC TRUTH - then you WILL find the truth.</p>
  <p>So...</p>
  <p>You gotta ask yourself as soon as possible...</p>
  <p>What do you want? And why do you want <i>that</i>?</p>
  <p>What have you been finding?</p>
  <p>What motivates you to live the life you live?</p>
  <p>Who are you listening to? Who influences you and in what way do they support you?</p>
  <p>Who is your first and foremost role model? We all have one.</p>
  <p>What is your life about?</p>
  <p><i>Who</i> is your life about?</p>
  <p>When you answer these questions <b>honestly</b>, then it will be made known to you why you have the truth. Or why you don't have the truth.</p>
  <p>***</p>
  <p>You need Jesus - the truth - in order to be saved.</p>
  <p>Saved from what? In short - your sins, death, and hell after.</p>
  <p>No matter what this evil world tells you otherwise, bear in mind that it is an evil world, and remember that truly the physical death of these earthly bodies is not the end of experience for you and your soul. The story goes on. For all of us.</p>
  <p>It is more than likely that modern mind control has successfully convinced you to dismiss the reality of hell - to characterize such a place as absurd, not worth contemplation. I say this in hope that your psychology can break through some serious programming and begin to understand that the narrative of life this world feeds you is a false and deliberately deceptive narrative.</p>
  <p>It is no surprise when you understand that evil is real, and how there are legitimate evil forces at work <i>against</i> <b>you personally</b> and who are actively plotting your detriment, then you begin to see how evil would want to keep the saving knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ obscure and in the dark.</p>
  <p>Read on if you want a bite of the light.</p>
  <p>***</p>
  <p>I'm screamin at you here - I'm in your face, shaking your shoulders, slapping you so you might wake up, yelling in your ear so that you can't say you didn't hear it from me.</p>
  <p>It is completely up to you what information you choose to believe in this world. Pray to God that what you trust in is the absolute, uncorrupted truth. You don't get to choose what truth is. Truth is what it is. Period. And you either believe it or you reject it. Be always cautious and careful, because lies deliberately disguise themselves as close to the truth so that they may take you away for themselves instead of the actual truth. Pray to God that you don't prefer a lie over the absolute, objective truth.</p>
  <p>I can't make you do anything you don't want to do. And I wouldn't want to do that even if I could.</p>
  <p>But I care about you. Because you're human. Just like me.</p>
  <p>And we live in a lost and dark world which is doing its best to get us to forget that - that each of us are human individuals.</p>
  <p>And so I'm doing the only thing I can do - pass along the true message - Jesus Christ and Him crucified.</p>
  <p>It is between you and God on judgment day as to whether you believed Him or not.</p>
  <p>It is between you and God on judgment day as to whether you knew Him - the incorruptible, eternal truth who displayed Himself for the world as Jesus Christ - or whether you rejected Him and said in your heart, "I would prefer it if this other narrative were the truth, so then I could do things the way I like to do things."</p>
  <p>I only wish to communicate sincere honesty to you. I have no ulterior motive here. I just know Jesus is the answer to the lifelong question we all continually ask ourselves...and I know what comparative despair and vanity fills the human soul apart from the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The purpose of life is to know Jesus. And I don't want you to miss out on your purpose.</p>
  <p>And so this website is my love letter to the people that share this dark and lost world which preaches vanity because it neglects the truth of Jesus Christ - how He is the Lord and the Lord is the true fulfillment of all things.</p>
  <p>And until that truth is accepted, this world will never have peace.</p>
  <p>But in the interim, until the real Jesus Christ reigns one day from the very city of Jerusalem, human individuals may have peace if their soul can come to accept the truth.</p>
  <p>If they can admit that they are wrong for the job of being god, and Jesus Christ is the right guy for the task.</p>
  <p>Simple as that.</p>
  <p>Problem is...</p>
  <p>Truly acknowledging and understanding that means changing a lot about you - Jesus says you have to be born again to enter into His kingdom.</p>
  <p>It means you are so far away from the truth busy being your own god before knowing Jesus, and Jesus Christ is so truly, undeniably Lord of everything (something everyone will see for themselves in the end, whether they have accepted Him as Lord or rejected Him as Lord before that), that recognizing how you are not the Lord of your life but Jesus Christ truly is...it's such a soul-shattering powerful revelation of truth that you become a new creation, born again - your old self-centered and sinful self cast away for good, and the new self with Jesus as the center of your life ruling and edifying you by the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p>The point is...you get to decide. Who knows better - you or God? Who do you trust more - you or God? Who do you like more - you or God? Who do you love more - you or God?</p>
  <p>And no one gets in the way of that being completely your decision. But I just want you to fully understand...God will hold you accountable for your decision.</p>
  <p>By <i>your</i> faith <i>you</i> decide if you inherit heaven or hell.</p>
  <p><u>2 Peter 3:9</u></p>
  <p>"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
  <p>The Lord wants NO ONE to perish, but without knowing the Lord, you perish. There's no room for legitimate complaint here. God has given you everything you have AND ample time to repent and get to know Him AND a perfect book with everything you need to know about life and God until you meet God face to face.</p>
  <p>God has provided the way to Him, which is open to anyone who accepts the way to Him...the ball is in your court. The Lord sacrificed everything for each of us on the cross, and it's your responsibility as His creation to choose to either accept Him...or reject Him.</p>
  <p><i>God has already decided He wants you. He died for you on the cross so that you could live with Him. All that is left is for you to decide whether you want the truth or not. Your life is a reflection of what you want. Do you pursue God and the real truth or do you pursue the world and gratifying yourself? This is what your time on earth is proving.</i></p>
  <p>But clearly based on the status of the world the deception enticing you to reject Him runs deep.</p>
  <p>The point is...the fate of <i>your</i> soul lies in <i>your</i> hands...are you going to place your soul with the eternal good Lord of everything which promises you eternal life with Him...or are you going to hide your soul in the world, hoping the Lord won't see you?</p>
  <p>Newsflash...the Lord God sees <i>everything</i>. So come on out into His light and realize that the more you surrender to Him, the freer and more joyful you will be.</p>
  <p>According to <i>your</i> belief and in whom <i>you</i> put <i>your</i> trust, <i>you</i> determine whether you inherit eternity with God, or eternity apart from God.</p>
  <p>TURN FROM YOUR OWN WAYS AND THE WAYS OF THE WORLD WHICH ALWAYS END IN DEATH AND THEN HELL</p>
  <p>AND TURN TO THE WAY OF GOD WHICH IS FOUND <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbb4xwYj19g" target="_blank"><b>ONLY</b></a> IN JESUS CHRIST AND YIELDS EVERLASTING LIFE, THE SECRET HOPE OF ALL LIFE - TRUE AND RIGHTEOUS LIFE FOREVER AND EVER FROM TRUTH HIMSELF.</p>

  <p>***</p>

  <p>***</p>
  <p>................Do you believe now? Now that the unimaginable has happened?................</p>
  <p>Perhaps not even now. Wow. But how?</p>
  <p>That great delusion the true Lord God sent the world for rejecting Him no doubt. For loving falsehood when the truth is right in front of you.</p>
  <p>The delusion the world is now under is extremely strong.</p>
  <p>Know that you are soaking in it.</p>
  <p>Don't trust it. Whatever it was. Whatever it is.</p>
  <p>I love you so much. Like you have no idea.</p>
  <p>But until the power-drunk fools running this vain show meet their Maker, you gotta understand how you are in a system of control. This is their work, their magnum opus of heartless bloodshed and callous power grabs: <a href="http://www.threeworldwars.com/new-world-order.htm" target="_blank">The Epitome of the Pride of Man</a>...</p>
  <p>The jig is up. Come to Jesus and start investing in the everlasting kingdom that stands forever after their system of control crumbles for good.</p>
  <p>Now listen carefully to the truth, find a "King James Bible", and <i><b><u>trust <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD6HvGvBc2E" target="_blank">Yeshua</a></u></b></i> only if your soul is something you value...</p>

<p><u><h1>All Glory to God</h1></u></p>


<p>"I thought with melancholy how an author spends months writing a book, and maybe puts his heart's blood into it, and then it sits about unread till the reader has nothing else in the world to do."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Then I pondered the great complexity of God, the awesomeness of His power, the glorious depth of His love, seeing how He reflected himself so simply and so honestly and so directly and in so many different ways that all converged on and were held together by...Him.</p>
<p>And tears swelled to the brim of my being, as I was moved with great emotion, because it dawned on me how perfectly God hid himself, clothing himself out of sheer love and mercy for us, shining every crack of light of himself that He legitimately could into this dark and lost world through the purest and most innocent means:</p>
<p>The beauty and soul of written word.</p>
<p>God has put His blood into the Bible, and the world does not believe, does not regard, does not understand the truth of God which is open to all through the Holy Bible...</p>
<p>God has revealed everything pertinent to life and humanity and love and relationships and God and truth.</p>
<p>Everything anyone could ever want is more wholesomely fulfilled through God and His word.</p>
<p>God has declared the end from the beginning.</p>
<p>God spoke all that there is into existence...</p>
<p>And He has openly declared His sovereignty through His word...</p>
<p>How there will come a day when all will see God for who He is...</p>
<p>And every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess to God...</p>
<p>And all of this very true information is displayed openly on the words and pages of the Bible...</p>
<p>Open for everyone to see...</p>
<p>How great God is and how sweet is His victory...</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>But until that final day...</p>
<p>Great lies are permitted to run amuck. Deceptive lies from prideful spirits which know not the vengeance that comes their way from the righteous reaction of God to such evil.</p>
<p>We live in a world which is in opposition to God, feeding its population lies, leading its people astray, and laughing at the stupidity of the sheep who follow it to share in its destruction.</p>
<p>Calling the truth of God, the Holy Bible, lies and all kinds of falsehood.</p>
<p>Mischaracterizing and misunderstanding their own Creator, spewing falsehood and filled with fleshy hateful hearts, desperately in need of healing by the very Being they denounce, disregard, and disbelieve.</p>
<p>Preaching that worth and life are found in some other place than the words of God and God himself.</p>
<p>The ongoing fall and tragedy of this world is deep once seen clearly...</p>
<p>But praise be to God, for loving so well a world that is so lost...</p>
<p>A world full of people that are so lost...</p>
<p>...so lost...</p>
<p>...so crazily in the thick of it...</p>
<p>...so unbelievably lost...</p>
<p>...<i>they don't know that they are lost.</i></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>So if you want to behold truth, if you want to discern what is right, what is good, what is true...</p>
<p>If you want to understand the reality of the situation here. The reality of the situation here on earth and in your heart and soul and being.</p>
<p>Until truth comes to rule himself...</p>
<p><i><b>Understand that everything that is real and worth remembering is in the Bible.</b></i></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>And if the truth of the line above this one does not ring true to you...</p>
<p>May you dust off the closest Holy Bible, and read until it does...</p>
<p>For truly I tell you, <i>there is only hope for you as an individual through Jesus Christ, and there's no way of coming to know Jesus Christ other than <b>listening</b> to His words...</i></p>
  <p>***</p>
<p>“The primary purpose of reading the Bible is not to know the Bible but to know God.”</p>
<p>“The Holy Scriptures are our letters from home.”
  <p>"God’s Word is an inexhaustible spring of life."
    <p>“All Sacred Scriptures is but one book, and that one book is Christ, because all divine Scripture speaks of Christ, and all divine Scripture is fulfilled in Christ.”</p>
<p>“Within the covers of the Bible are the answers for all the problems men face.”</p>
<p>“This book out-lives, out-loves, out-fits, out-lasts, out-reaches, out-runs, and out-ranks all books. This book is faith producing. It is hope awakening. It is death destroying, and those who embrace it find forgiveness of sin.”</p>
<p>“Let us therefore yield ourselves and bow to the authority of the Holy Scriptures, which can neither err nor deceive.”</p>
<p>“Having knowledge of the Bible is essential to a rich and meaningful life.”</p>
<p>“If God is a reality, and the soul is a reality, and you are an immortal being, what are you doing with your Bible shut?”</p>
<p>“I beg of you, my dear brother, to live among these books - the scriptures of the living God, to meditate upon them, to know nothing else, to seek nothing else.”
<p>“I am profitably engaged in reading the Bible. Take all of this Book that you can by reason and the balance by faith, and you will live and die a better man. It is the best Book which God has given to man.”</p>
<p>“The Word of God I think of as a straight edge, which shows up our own crookedness. We can’t really tell how crooked our thinking is until we line it up with the straight edge of Scripture.”</p>
<p>“The Bible is very easy to understand. But we Christians are a bunch of scheming swindlers. We pretend to be unable to understand it because we know very well that the minute we understand, we are obliged to act accordingly.”</p>
<p>“The reason you don’t like the Bible, you old sinner, is because it knows all about you.”</p>
<p>“Listen less to your own thoughts and more to God’s thoughts.”</p>
<p>“The Bible is the most thought suggesting book in the world. No other deals with such grand themes.”</p>
<p>“The Bible is the light of my understanding, the joy of my heart, the fullness of my hope, the clarified of my affections, the mirror of my thoughts, the consoler of my sorrows, the guide of my soul through this gloomy labyrinth of time, the telescope sent from heaven to reveal to the eye of man the amazing glories of the far distant world.”</p>
<p>“If our children have the background of a godly, happy home and this unshakable faith that the Bible is indeed the Word of God, they will have a foundation that the forces of hell cannot shake.”</p>
<p>“A good church is a Bible-centered church. Nothing is as important as this–not a large congregation, a witty pastor, or tangible experiences of the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p>“The Bible is the greatest benefit which the human race has ever experienced. A single line in the Bible has consoled me more than all the books I ever read besides.”</p>
<p>“The Bible is the Word of life.  I beg that you will read it and find this out for yourself.  When you have read the Bible you will know it is the Word of God, because you will have found in it the key to your own heart, your own happiness, and your own duty.”</p>
<p><u>John 1:1-5</u></p>
<div class="redletters">
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</p>
<p>The same was in the beginning with God.</p>
<p>All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made.</p>
<p>In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</p>
<p>And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</p>

<p><u>Job 28:12-28</u></p>
<p>But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p>Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.</p>
<p>The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.</p>
<p>It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.</p>
<p>It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</p>
<p>The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.</p>
<p>No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.</p>
<p>The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</p>
<p>Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p>Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.</p>
<p>Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.</p>
<p>For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;</p>
<p>To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.</p>
<p>When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:</p>
<p>Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.</p>
<p>And unto man he said,</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Sometimes...when I realize I'm swimming in an ocean of self-centered worship...</p>
<p>My head barely above the surface of the water by the grace of God alone...</p>
<p>I look in all directions beneath the surface...</p>
<p>And I see the lost and how lost some are...</p>
<p>And I have compassion in my heart because I remember how lost I was...</p>
<p>But right now I am found, and my head is above the surface of this cannibalistic ocean...</p>
<p>And so I see the dawn approaching in the end...a beautiful spectacle planned since the beginning of it all...</p>
<p>But before that gets to happen, there must first be a righteous storm...</p>
<p>The answer to the misguided love of unrighteousness which infects the whole world...</p>
<p>And so I am floating there...</p>
<p>And the storm is strong and a hurricane of judgment is looming far and wide...</p>
<p>I know because my head is above the water, breathing air for the first time, able to see what is coming...</p>
<p>And so I see the storm quickly approaching, and I remember my fellow lost brethren, who don't know that they are under water, not supposed to be there.</p>
<p>And I plead with God, "Lord, bless 'em. Lord, save 'em. Lord, bring 'em up to the surface so they know what's going on."</p>
<p>And before the Lord answers me,</p>
<p>This is what I am shown:</p>
<p>Truth walking among liars.</p>
<p>Truth proclaiming the truth candidly. Openly. For all to believe.</p>
<p>Truth being so powerful, and yet so humble so as to sacrifice itself in order to save lying scumbags...</p>
<p>Truth walking on water, healing the sick, raising the dead, giving sight to the blind, releasing the prisoners of this ocean of self-consuming vanity, an ocean which truly has a sea monster roaming about that weaves a web of lies around its unfortunate inhabitants so that they ball up in comfort and sink to the bottom, not knowing they are being deceived unto death at the bottom of this evil ocean, not knowing that there is a surface to break through at the top of it all.</p>
<p>Then I am struck by how devastating it must be...</p>
<p>For truth to come down from heaven...</p>
<p>For truth to live a perfect and good and honest and true life and then get sentenced to death by its own creation...</p>
<p>For truth to endure the torture and punishment by mankind, its very own creation (the punishment in fact mankind was righteously deserving of)...</p>
<p>For truth to get nailed to a cross at Calvary...</p>
<p>For truth to get mocked and ridiculed endlessly, both on the cross, as he was dying for the very same people that mocked him, and afterward...</p>
<p>For truth to get crucified...</p>
<p>For truth to bear the sins of the entirety of mankind...</p>
<p>For truth to die...</p>
<p>...for truth to be buried...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...but then on the third day...</p>
<p>For truth to be resurrected to eternal life!</p>
<p>I am struck by how devastating it must be...</p>
<p>For truth to do all of this for each one of us - every man and woman of every age, race, creed, color...</p>
<p>AND FOR PEOPLE TO NOT BELIEVE IN THE TRUTH.</p>
<p>FOR PEOPLE NOT TO TRUST THE TRUTH.</p>
<p>FOR PEOPLE TO NOT SEE HOW MUCH <h1>THE TRUTH IS ON YOUR SIDE</h1></p>
<p>FOR PEOPLE TO NOT SEE HOW MUCH <h1>THE TRUTH HAS YOUR BEST INTERESTS IN MIND</h1></p>
<p>FOR PEOPLE TO NOT SEE HOW MUCH <h1>THE TRUTH LOVES YOU</h1></p>
<p>And so now the Lord answers me,</p>
<p>"Take care, for I have overcome the world. But it is impossible to please me without faith. So, right now, people that do not believe in me, do not have me, and will not know me like those who believe in me."</p>
<p>And then I think to myself, though the waves of doubt and deceit are strong against those that I know (and those that I don't know)...</p>
<p>If the Lord can do all that He does, and endure the disbelief and the rejection of the world...</p>
<p>Then surely I can endure the disbelief and doubt and rejection of certain individuals in my circle of people - my family, my friends, my acquaintances, my strangers, and any and all who do not believe in the truth despite it being eternally present. The disbelief of fellow men and women that can't see the truth right in front of them. The doubt of fellow brothers and sisters that are stuck in lies for the time being. The rejection of certain individuals who cannot see reality for what it is becaus of a veil...not fully grasping how whenever you turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away!</p>
<p>And so I will continue to call out to the lost, until the storm of awful judgment hits this unbelieving world.</p>
<p>Securely swimming toward the heavenly shore by the strength of the Lord alone...</p>
<p>Crushed by the devastating lack of belief and lack of faith in the drowning doubters who seal their eternal death through rejecting such graceful truth.</p>
<p>So until - hey, you out there - yes, you - until you see the truth with your very own eyes...</p>
<p>Pick up a King James Bible, trust every word of His, and find His truth in every curve of every letter...</p>
<p>His Spirit will lead you to what you need to read, to see, to experience, to do, to know, to feel, to understand...</p>
<p>As long as you hold fast to Jesus Christ, the living and breathing truth, and that which He commands:</p>
<p><u>Matthew 22:37-40</u></p>
<p>Jesus said unto him,
  <div class="redletters">
    Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</p>
    <p>This is the first and great commandment.</p>
    <p>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
    <p>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p>

<p><u>Ecclesiastes 12:8-14</u></p>
<p>Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.</p>
<p>And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</p>
<p>The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.</p>
<p>The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.</p>
<p>And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</p>
<div class="redletters">
<p>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.</p>
</div>
<p>For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</p>

<p><u>Colossians 1:10-20</u></p>
<p>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</p>
<p>Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;</p>
<p>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:</p>
<p>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:</p>
<p>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:</p>
<p>Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:</p>
<div class="redletters">
  <p>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</p>
  <p>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</p>
  </div>
  <p>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</p>
  <p>For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;</p>
  <p>And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</p>

  <p>"Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer; nothing is more difficult than to understand him."</p>
  <p>"Patty Keene was stupid on purpose, which was the case with most people in Midland City. The people all had big minds because they were big animals, but they did not use them much for this reason: unusual ideas could make enemies, and the people, if they were going to achieve any sort of comfort and safety, needed all the friends they could get. So, in the interests of survival, they trained themselves to be agreeing machines instead of thinking machines. All their minds had to do was to discover what other people were thinking, and then they thought that, too."</p>
  <p>"At the peak of his intelligence, Algernon's performance had become variable. There were times, according to Burt's report, when Algernon refused to work at all - even when apparently hungry - and other times when he would solve the problem but, instead of taking his good reward, would hurl himself against the walls of his cage."</p>
  <p>"It was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working hours or shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because, being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice."</p>

  <p>"Because of sin, awe of God is very quickly replaced by awe of self. What this means is that we don't think, desire, purpose, want, or plan as we should. We want our will to be done. We want the freedom to do what we want to do when we want to do it. We want our life to be comfortable and our days predictable. We want the people around us to appreciate, indulge, and serve us. We don't want people to disagree with us or tell us that we are wrong. We want affluence without hard work, and we want to do what pleases us without consequences. Sin leaves us tragically broken at the deepest of motivational levels, that is, at the level of our capacity for awe. Now when God draws you to himself, you are completely forgiven and unconditionally accepted by him, but the battle for the awe of your heart continues...Spiritual growth is about recapturing your awe. The more that the awe of God rules the motivation systems of your heart, the more you will love his kingdom and find pleasure in his work and satisfaction in doing his will. Romans 12:2 talks of being "transformed by the renewal of your mind." There it is. The mind is where the change needs to take place. If grace does not transform my motivation, it will not alter my living."

  <p><i>I am <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-8PBx7isoM" target="_blank"><b>seated</b></a> in an office, surrounded by heads and bodies. My posture is consciously congruent to the shape of my hard chair. This is a cold room in University Administration, wood-walled, Remington-hung, double-windowed against the November heat, insulated from Administrative sounds by the reception area outside, at which Uncle Charles, Mr. deLint and I were lately received.</p>
    <p>I am in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQSzk44hBmk" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0H3s1138xE" target="_blank"><b>...</b></a></p>
    <br>
    <p>'...a bright, solid, but very shy boy, we know about your being very shy, Kirk White's told us what your athletically built if rather stand-offish younger instructor told him,' the Director says softly, cupping what I feel to be a hand over my sportcoat's biceps (surely not), 'who simply needs to swallow hard and trust and tell his side of the story to these gentlemen who bear no maliciousness none at all but are doing our jobs and trying to look out for everyone's interests at the same time.'</p>
    <p>I can picture deLint and White sitting with their elbows on their knees in the defecatory posture of all athletes at rest, deLint staring at his huge thumbs, while C.T. in the reception area paces in a tight ellipse, speaking into his portable phone. I have been coached for this like a Don before a RICO hearing. A neutral and affectless silence. The sort of all-defensive game Schtitt used to have me play: the best defense: let everything bounce off you; do nothing. I'd tell you all you want and more, if the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY2D0j454PI&t=2m38s" target="_blank"><b>sounds</b></a> I made could be what you hear.</p>
    <p>Athletics with his head out from under his wing: '- to avoid admission procedures that could be seen as primarily athletics-oriented. It could be a mess, son.'</p>
    <p>'Bill means <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xog7e0iHVuE" target="_blank"><b>the appearance, not necessarily the real true facts of the matter</b></a>, which you alone can fill in,' says the Director of Composition.</p>
    <p>'- the appearance of the high athletic ranking, the subnormal scores, the over-academic essays, the incredible grades vortexing out of what could be seen as a nepotistic situation.'</p>
    <p>The yellow Dean has leaned so far forward that his tie is going to have a horizontal dent from the table-edge, his face sallow and kindly and no-s***-whatever:</p>
    <p>'Look here, Mr. Incandenza, Hal, please just explain to me why we couldn't be accused of using you, son. Why nobody could come and say to us, why, look here, University of Arizona, here you are using a boy for just his body, a boy so shy and withdrawn he won't speak up for himself, a jock with doctored marks and a store-bought application.'</p>
    <p>The Brewster's-Angle light of the tabletop appears as a rose flush behind my closed lids. I cannot make myself understood. 'I am not just a jock,' I say slowly. Distinctly. 'My transcript for the last year might have been dickied a bit, maybe, but that was to get me over a rough spot. The grades prior to that are <i>de moi</i>.' My eyes are closed; the room is silent. 'I cannot make myself understood, now.' I am speaking slowly and distinctly. 'Call it something I ate.'</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>'My application's not bought,' I am telling them, calling into the darkness of the red cave that opens out before closed eyes. 'I am not just a boy who plays tennis. I have an intricate history. Experiences and feelings. I'm complex.</p>
    <p>'I <i>read</i>,' I say. 'I study and read. I bet I've read everything you've read. Don't think I haven't. I consume libraries. I wear out spines and ROM-drives. I do things like get in a taxi and say, "The library, and step on it." My instincts concerning syntax and mechanics are better than your own, I can tell, with due respect.</p>
    <p>'But it transcends the mechanics. I'm not a machine. I feel and believe. I have opinions. Some of them are interesting. I could, if you'd let me, talk and talk. Let's talk about anything. I believe the influence of Kierkegaard on Camus is underestimated. I believe Dennis Gabor may very well have been the Antichrist. I believe Hobbes is just Rousseau in a dark mirror. I believe, with Hegel, that transcendence is absorption. I could interface you guys right under the table,' I say. 'I'm not just a creatus, manufactured, conditioned, bred for a function.'</p>
    <p>I open my eyes. 'Please don't think I don't care.'</p>
    <p>I look out. Directed my way is horror. I rise from the chair. I see jowls sagging, eyebrows high on trembling foreheads, cheeks bright-white. The chair recedes below me.</p>
    <p>'Sweet mother of Christ,' the Director says.</p>
    <p>'I'm fine,' I tell them, standing. From the yellow Dean's expression, there's a brutal wind blowing from my direction. Academics' face has gone instantly old. Eight eyes have become blank discs that stare at whatever they see.</p>
    <p>'Good God,' whispers Athletics.</p>
    <p>'Please don't worry,' I say. 'I can explain.' I soothe the air with a casual hand.</p>
    <p>Both my arms are pinioned from behind by the Director of Comp., who wrestles me roughly down, on me with all his weight. I taste floor.</p>
    <p>'What's <i>wrong?</i>'</p>
    <p>I say '<i>Nothing</i> is wrong.'</p>
    <p>'It's all <i>right!</i> I'm <i>here</i>,' the Director is calling into my ear.</p>
    <p>'Get help!' cries a Dean.</p>
    <p>My forehead is pressed into parquet I never knew could be so cold. I am arrested. I try to be perceived as limp and pliable. My face is mashed flat; Comp.'s weight makes it hard to breathe.</p>
    <p>'Try to listen,' I say very slowly, muffled by the floor.</p>
    <p>'What in God's name are those...,' one Dean cries shrilly, '...those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYy0o-J0x20" target="_blank"><i>sounds?</i></a>'</p>
    <p>There are clicks of a phone console's buttons, shoes' heels moving, pivoting, a sheaf of flimsy pages falling.</p>
    <p>'<i>God!</i>'</p>
    <p>'<i>Help!</i>'</p>
    <p>The door's base opens at the left periphery: a wedge of halogen hall-light, white sneakers and a scuffed Nunn Bush. 'Let him <i>up!</i>' That's deLint.</p>
    <p>'There is nothing wrong,' I say slowly to the floor. 'I'm in here.'</p>
    <p>I'm raised by the crutches of my underarms, shaken toward what he must see as calm by a purple-faced Director: 'Get a <i>grip</i>, son!'</p>
    <p>DeLint at the big man's arm: '<i>Stop</i> it!'</p>
    <p>'I am not what you see and hear.'</p>
    <p>Distant sirens. A crude half nelson. Forms at the door. A young Hispanic woman holds her palm against her mouth, looking.</p>
    <p>'I'm not,' I say.</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>You have to love old-fashioned men's rooms: the citrus scent of deodorant disks in the long porcelain trough; the stalls with wooden doors in frames of cool marble; these thin sinks in rows, basins supported by rickety alphabets of exposed plumbing; mirrors over metal shelves; behind all the voices the slight sound of a ceaseless trickle, inflated by echo against wet porcelain and a cold tile floor whose mosaic pattern looks almost Islamic at this close range.</p>
    <p>The disorder I've caused revolves all around. I've been half-dragged, still pinioned, through a loose mob of Administrative people by the Comp. Director - who appears to have thought variously that I am having a seizure (prying open my mouth to check for a throat clear of tongue), that I am somehow choking (a textbook Heimlich that left me whooping), that I am psychotically out of control (various postures and grips designed to transfer that control to him) - while about us roil deLint, trying to restrain the Director's restraint of me, the varsity tennis coach restraining deLint, my mother's half-brother speaking in rapid combinations of polysyllables to the trio of Deans, who variously gasp, wring hands, loosen neckties, waggle digits in C.T.'s face, and make <i>pases</i> with sheafs of now-pretty-clearly-superfluous application forms.</p>
    <p>I am rolled over supine on the geometric tile. I am concentrating docilely on the question why U.S. restrooms always appear to us as infirmaries for public distress, the place to regain control. My head is cradled in a knelt Director's lap, which is soft, my face being swabbed with dusty-brown institutional paper towels he received from some hand out of the crowd overhead, staring with all the blankness I can summon into his jowls' small pocks, worst at the blurred jaw-line, of scarring from long-ago acne. Uncle Charles, a truly unparalleled slinger of s***, is laying down an enfilade of same, trying to mollify men who seem way more in need of a good brow-mopping than I.</p>
    <p>'He's fine,' he keeps saying. 'Look at him, calm as can be, lying there.'</p>
    <p>'You didn't see what <i>happened</i> in there,' a hunched Dean responds through a face webbed with fingers.</p>
    <p>'Excited, is all he gets, sometimes, an excitable kid, impressed with -'</p>
    <p>'But the <i>sounds</i> he made.'</p>
    <p>'Undescribable.'</p>
    <p>'Like an animal.'</p>
    <p>'<i>Sub</i>animalistic noises and sounds.'</p>
    <p>'Nor let's not forget the <i>gestures</i>.'</p>
    <p>'Have you ever gotten <i>help</i> for this boy Dr. Tavis?'</p>
    <p>'Like some sort of animal with something in its mouth.'</p>
    <p>'This boy is damaged.'</p>
    <p>'Like a stick of butter being hit with a mallet.'</p>
    <p>'A writhing animal with a knife in its eye.'</p>
    <p>'What were you possibly <i>about</i>, trying to enroll this -'</p>
    <p>'And his <i>arms</i>.'</p>
    <p>'You didn't see it, Tavis. His arms were -'</p>
    <p>'Flailing. This sort of awful reaching drumming wriggle. <i>Waggling</i>,' the group looking briefly at someone outside my sight trying to demonstrate something.</p>
    <p>'Like a time-lapse, a flutter of some sort of awful...growth.'</p>
    <p>'Sounded most of all like a drowning goat. A goat, drowning in something viscous.'</p>
    <p>'This strangled series of bleats and -'</p>
    <p>'Yes they <i>waggled</i>'</p>
    <p>'So suddenly a bit of excited waggling's a crime, now?'</p>
    <p>'You, sir, are in trouble. You are <i>in trouble</i>.'</p>
    <p>'His face. As if he was strangling. Burning. I believe I've seen a vision of hell.'</p>
    <p>'He has some trouble communicating, he's communicatively challenged, no one's denying that.'</p>
    <p>'The boy needs <i>care</i>.'</p>
    <p>'Instead of caring for the boy you send him here to <i>enroll, compete?</i>'</p>
    <p>'Hal?'</p>
    <p>'You have not in your most dreadful fantasies dreamt of the amount of <i>trouble</i> you have brought yourself, Dr. so-called Headmaster, <i>educator</i>.'</p>
    <p>'...were given to understand this was all just a formality. You took him aback, is all. Shy -'</p>
    <p>'And you, White. You sought to <i>recruit</i> him!'</p>
    <p>'- and terribly impressed and excited, in there, without us, his support system, whom you asked to leave, which if you'd -'</p>
    <p>'I'd only seen him play. On court he's gorgeous. Possibly a genius. We had no idea. The brother's in the bloody NFL for God's sake. Here's a top player, we thought, with Southwest roots. His stats were off the chart. We watched him through the whole WhataBurger last fall. Not a waggle or a noise. We were watching ballet out there, a mate remarked, after.'</p>
    <p>'Damn right you were watching ballet out there, White. This boy is a balletic athlete, a player.'</p>
    <p>'Some kind of athletic savant then. Balletic compensation for deep problems which <i>you</i> sir choose to disguise by muzzling the boy in there.' An expensive pair of Brazilian espadrilles goes by on the left and enters a stall, and the espadrilles come around and face me. The urinal trickles behind the voices' small echoes.</p>
    <p>'- haps we'll just be on our way,' C.T. is saying.</p>
    <p>'The integrity of my sleep has been forever compromised, sir.'</p>
    <p>'- think you could pass off a damaged applicant, fabricate credentials and shunt him through a kangaroo-interview and inject him into all the rigors of college life?'</p>
    <p>'Hal here <i>functions</i>, you a**. Given a supportive situation. He's fine when he's by himself. Yes he has some trouble with excitability in conversation. Did you once hear him try to deny that?'</p>
    <p>'We witnessed something only marginally <i>mammalian</i> in there, sir.'</p>
    <p>'Like hell. Have a look. How's the excitable little guy doing down there, Aubrey, does it look to you?'</p>
    <p>'You, sir, are quite possibly ill. This affair is not concluded.'</p>
    <p>'What <i>ambulance?</i> Don't you guys <i>listen?</i> I'm telling you there's -'</p>
    <p>'Hal? Hal?'</p>
    <p>'Dope him up, seek to act as his mouthpiece, muzzling, and now he lies there catatonic, staring.'</p>
    <p>The crackle of deLint's knees. 'Hal?'</p>
    <p>'- inflate this publicly in any distorted way. The Academy has distinguished alumni, litigators at counsel. Hal here is provably competent. Credentials out the bazoo, Bill. The boy reads like a vacuum. <i>Digests</i> things.'</p>
    <p>I simply lie there, listening, smelling the paper towel, watching an espadrille pivot.</p>
    <p>'There's more to life than sitting there interfacing, it might be a newsflash to you.'</p>
    <p>And who could not love that special and leonine roar of a public toilet?</p>

    <br>
    <p>All the words contained herein are dedicated to those who are in love with Jesus, the powerful authority of all creation, the lover despite our hate, the fullness to our emptiness.</p>
    <p>But even more so, this website is dedicated to all the people who do not give credence to the veracity of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>To the people who do not even have the off-chance to walk in the door of a place like this, a place where truth is truly revered, and to people who certainly don't have the patience to entertain what certainly must be fabricated fairy tales, such delusions of grandeur to the mind attached to the world.</p>
    <p>To the people whose being is so steeped in sin that they are blind to the evil they are both a victim and a villain of.</p>
    <p>But most of all,</p>
    <p>To the people who will never see this text, and are in some far off place, their mind also far off, dancing horrifically on the surface of spacetime, unaware of the evil that lurks close by and the good that perfectly waits for more people to choose Him before said evil is pulverized.</p>
    <br>

  <p><i>To the people that do not know the wealth of fulfillment that is a mere penny from the currency Jesus Christ deals in and provides for those who love Him, who obey Him, who <b>believe</b> Him.</i></p>

  <p>If you do not know the Lord, may you open up the nearest Bible, read the eternal nature of Jesus Christ our Lord, and give your life to the truth, the only thing which will truly stand the test of time - Him and that which He chooses to bring with Him.</p>
  <p>May you call on Him in days of sorrow and lean on Him evermore in days of your triumph.</p>
  <p>And may you recognize that all spectrums of experience are at His beck and call, for His holy purposes, which He reveals to us when He sees fit, and which are so much greater than we can see with our two eyes stuck to the natural limits of our earthly horizon.</p>
  <p>May the words of our Lord encourage your spirit in moments of all kinds, may the revelation of His character and His name be evidence of His infinite worthiness, and may the recognition of the depth of His love, coupled with knowledge of His agony on the victorious cross fill yourself with the truest joy, a joy which withstands the setting of the sun and all the mayhem of the night because of its foundation in the real, pure, unshakable truth.</p>
  <p>May you come to know the Lord, through whatever amazing path He leads you down, and may the words from His mouth do wonders for your heart, but more so than anything - may His teaching and wisdom surrounding the crucifixion - His resilience and care in the face of hatred and injustice; may His action on the cross - His willingness, His initiative, His death despite His perfection; may His resurrection and its truth - His promises fulfilled, His sovereignty edified, His glory of life revealed - may Jesus Christ and the gospel of truth resonate with you to your core, and you choose life for the rest of your days.</p>

  <p>...Which highlights so many things, but especially how we as mere men and women know nothing, and are nothing, but the love of God is so great that <i>it is His will to make us into something...something truly <b>good</b></i>...and to teach us His perfect love and His perfect law along the way, sharing the light of His Spirit which is Truth...to walk with us both as a loving Father but also as an understanding and forgiving friend...I mean, c'mon, y'all, it doesn't get any better than that really...when you serve the God of everything and His <b>character</b> is so, so, so good, AND His <b>love</b> is so...indescribably amazing...there are no words in the English language that come close to explaining the <i>goodness</i> that is in the Lord God Almighty...when you know that you have Him as your present and your future...whooooooooa, everything turns gorgeous...Amen Amen Amen......anyone who reads this and wants the perfect epitome of love for themselves - found nowhere outside of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, come join the eternal and good family of God and become sincerely redeemed through Christ...God wants you, but in order to say yes to God, you must believe His Son...may the peace that surpasses understanding be with you...

  <p><u>The Book of Job, Chapter 38</u></p>
  <p><b>Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>
    <p>Who <i>is</i> this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</p>
    <p>Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.</p>
    <p>Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.</p>
    <p>Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?</p>
    <p>Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;</p>
    <p>When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</p>
    <p>Or <i>who</i> shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, <i>as if</i> it had issued out of the womb?</p>
    <p>When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,</p>
    <p>And brake up for it my decreed <i>place</i>, and set bars and doors,</p>
    <p>And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?</p>
    <p>Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; <i>and</i> caused the dayspring to know his place;</p>
    <p>That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?</p>
    <p>It is turned as clay <i>to</i> the seal; and they stand as a garment.</p>
    <p>And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.</p>
    <p>Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?</p>
    <p>Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?</p>
    <p>Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.</p>
    <p>Where <i>is</i> the way <i>where</i> light dwelleth? and <i>as for</i> darkness, where <i>is</i> the place thereof,</p>
    <p>That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths <i>to</i> the house thereof?</p>
    <p>Knowest thou <i>it</i>, because thou wast then born? or <i>because</i> the number of thy days <i>is</i> great?</p>
    <p>Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,</p>
    <p>Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?</p>
    <p>By what way is the light parted, <i>which</i> scattereth the east wind upon the earth?</p>
    <p>Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;</p>
    <p>To cause it to rain on the earth, <i>where</i> no man <i>is, on</i> the wilderness, wherein <i>there is</i> no man;</p>
    <p>To satisfy the desolate and waste <i>ground</i>, and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?</p>
    <p>Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</p>
    <p>Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?</p>
    <p>The waters are hid as <i>with</i> a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.</p>
    <p>Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?</p>
    <p>Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?</p>
    <p>Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?</p>
    <p>Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?</p>
    <p>Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee, Here we <i>are?</i></p>
    <p>Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?</p>
    <p>Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,</p>
    <p>When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?</p>
    <p>Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,</p>
    <p>When they couch in <i>their</i> dens, <i>and</i> abide in the covert to lie in wait?</p>
    <p>Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.</p>

    <br>
    <p><u>Chapter 39</u></p>
    <b><p>Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? <i>or</i> canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?</p>
      <p>Canst thou number the months <i>that</i> they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</p>
      <p>They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.</p>
      <p>Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.</p>
      <p>Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?</p>
      <p>Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.</p>
      <p>He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.</p>
      <p>The range of the mountains <i>is</i> his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.</p>
      <p>Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?</p>
      <p>Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</p>
      <p>Wilt thou trust him, because his strength <i>is</i> great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?</p>
      <p>Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather <i>it into</i> thy barn?</p>
      <p><i>Gavest thou</i> the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?</p>
      <p>Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,</p>
      <p>And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.</p>
      <p>She is hardened against her young ones, as though <i>they were</i> not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;</p>
      <p>Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.</p>
      <p>What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.</p>
      <p>Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?</p>
      <p>Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils <i>is</i> terrible.</p>
      <p>He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in <i>his</i> strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.</p>
      <p>He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.</p>
      <p>The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.</p>
      <p>He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that <i>it is</i> the sound of the trumpet.</p>
      <p>He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</p>
      <p>Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, <i>and</i> stretch her wings toward the south?</p>
      <p>Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?</p>
      <p>She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.</p>
      <p>From thence she seeketh the prey, <i>and</i> her eyes behold afar off.</p>
      <p>Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain <i>are</i>, there <i>is</i> she.</p>

    <p><u>Chapter 40</u></p>
    <b><p>Moreover the Lord answered Job, and said,</p>
      <p>Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct <i>him?</i> he that reproveth God, let him answer it.</p>
      <p>Then Job answered the Lord, and said,</p>
      <p>Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.</p>
      <p>Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.</p>
      <p>Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>
      <p>Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</p>
      <p>Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</p>

      <p>Deck thyself now <i>with</i> majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.</p>
      <p>Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one <i>that is</i> proud, and abase him.</p>

      <p>Lo now, his strength <i>is</i> in his loins, and his force <i>is</i> in the navel of his belly.</p>
      <p>He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.</p>
      <p>His bones <i>are as</i> strong pieces of brass; his bones <i>are</i> like bars of iron.</p>
      <p>He <i>is</i> the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach <i>unto him</i>.</p>
      <p>Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</p>
      <p>He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</p>
      <p>The shady trees cover him <i>with</i> their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</p>
      <p>Behold, he drinketh up a river, <i>and</i> hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</p>

      <p><i>His</i> scales <i>are his</i> pride, shut up together <i>as with</i> a close seal.</p>
      <p>One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</p>
      <p>They're joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</p>
      <p>By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes <i>are</i> like the eyelids of the morning.</p>
      <p>Out of his mouth go burning lamps, <i>and</i> sparks of fire leap out.</p>
      <p>Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as <i>out</i> of a seething pot or caldron.</p>
      <p>His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</p>
      <p>In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</p>
      <p>The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</p>
      <p>His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether <i>millstone.</i></p>
      <p>When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</p>
      <p>The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</p>
      <p>He esteemeth iron as straw, <i>and</i> brass as rotten wood.</p>
      <p>The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</p>
      <p>Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</p>
      <p>Sharp stones <i>are</i> under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</p>
      <p>He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</p>
      <p>He maketh a path to shine after him; <i>one</i> would think the deep <i>to be</i> hoary.</p>
      <p>Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</p>

    <p><u>Chapter 42</u></p>
    <b><p>Then Job answered the Lord, and said,</p>
      <p>I know that thou canst do every <i>thing</i>, and <i>that</i> no thought can be withholden from thee.</p>
      <p>Who <i>is</i> he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</p>
      <p>Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</p>
      <p>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</p>
      <p>Wherefore I abhor <i>myself</i>, and repent in dust and ashes.</p>
      <p>And it was <i>so</i>, that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me <i>the thing that is</i> right, as my servant Job <i>hath</i>.</p>
      <p>Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you <i>after your</i> folly, in that ye have not spoken of me <i>the thing which is</i> right, like my servant Job.</p>
      <p>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite <i>and</i> Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the Lord commanded them: the Lord also accepted Job.</p>
      <p>And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.</p>
      <p>Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</p>
      <p>So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</p>
      <p>He had also seven sons and three daughters.</p>
      <p>And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</p>
      <p>And in all the land were no women found <i>so</i> fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</p>
      <br>
      <p>After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, <i>even</i> four generations.</p>
      <p>So Job died, <i>being</i> old and full of days.</p>

    <p>So many symbols to attempt to symbolize the invisible!</p>
    <p>But, fine, I say</p>
    <p>I get it, okay</p>
    <p>Reading requires original work</p>
    <p><i>It's critically creative commerce</i></p>

    <p>To where you surely must go</p>
    <p>So you can smile and say,</p>
    <p>"I did it my way!"</p>
    <br>
    <p>What is so critical to learn is this: your way will never be enough.</p>
    <p>Your way won't cut it.</p>
    <p>Your way will never give you fullness of life.</p>
    <p>Your way will always let you down in the end.</p>
    <p>So come to Jesus, my friend.</p>
    <p>He is always enough!</p>
    <p>He will provide fullness of life.</p>
    <p>He will never let you down in the end.</p>
    <br>
    <p><i>Jesus is Lord.</p>
      <p>If you do not know this at your core in your soul, you are not right with God.</p>
      <p>We are all born not right with God, because we all have sinned - we are all sinners.</p>
      <p>To sin is to do wrong by someone.</p>
      <p>And when the reality is that there is a perfect and holy and righteous and true God.</p>
      <p>Who created a wonderful creation - mankind - in order to be in relationship with the Creator.</p>
      <p>The perfect Creator is gonna lay down the eternal moral law - He establishes what is good and what is evil. He dictates what to do and what not to do.</p>
      <p>If you don't agree that the Being who sees everything and knows everything has a right understanding of what is good and what is evil, then you're sadly mistaken.</p>
      <p>So, the first ordinance was for mankind to enjoy everything in the garden of God, but don't eat of this one tree.</p>
      <p>God the Creator was honest and sincere then and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZA0ESR6geU" target="_blank"><b>He is honest and sincere now</b></a>. He said plainly the truth - if you eat of this tree, you shall surely die.</p>
      <p>And...well, you're human, whaddaya think happened?</p>
      <p>Though we were given the truth of the matter, just like we have all been given the truth in Jesus Christ today, we love a little rebellion, don't we?</p>
      <p>And so because we sinned against the perfect, holy, righteous, true God, because we did wrong against the perfect, holy, righteous, true God...</p>
      <p>God cast mankind out of the garden of God, and death entered the realm of men, just like God had warned us, and the foolish heart of mankind which had wronged perfect, good, righteous Truth was darkened, and became an idol-factory of falsehood, a being that salivates at the notion of wronging God again.</p>
      <p>But God had a plan all along, for it was the will of God to be with mankind, for He loves them.</p>
      <p>But the wages of sin are always death, and so because mankind had sinned, mankind was sentenced to death and that which precedes death - decay, disarray, and dismay.</p>
      <p>But God knew of a perfect glitch in the matrix.</p>
      <p>Something that would completely reconcile mankind to Him - at least the only part that could ever be reconciled back to Him - the part of humanity that wanted to be with Him rather than the other part of humanity which loved their sinful state more than the perfect good righteous true God.</p>
      <p>So, God in His perfect love, sent His very own Son, His beloved, immaculate, perfect, good, righteous, true, Son to become a man and so live a perfect and sinless life that no other man could live, and then die the death that all mankind deserved for their wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>And Jesus Christ is this one and only Son of God, who was crucified for the sins of the world, so that through him the world might be saved.</p>
      <p>And so God has spoken salvation to mankind through His Son.</p>
      <p>So come to Jesus, believe in Him, and be saved from the grave.</p>
      <p>You are either aligned with the world, who rejects the free gift of salvation through Jesus Christ, the only way to reconnect eternally with God, because you would prefer to try to be your own god.</p>
      <p>Or you have put your faith in Jesus alone, and you have died to yourself so that you may live forever with Him.</p>
      <p>Because, truly, I tell you, we will either die with Jesus on the cross and live forever and ever, reborn in Him, our sins washed away and clean by the only power which can accomplish such a miracle, or suffer the righteous fate of evil and prideful and sinful and lost creations of God - hell - the place to go for creations that reject God's perfectly selfless offer of salvation, creations that deny God by denying His Son, creations that do not know what they do, who love to be dirty in sin rather than clean before God, who love the darkness rather than the light, lest the light expose them for being evil, and so choose to revel in their lostness rather than being found.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Late into the night,</p>
        <p>Frailty pumps my blood.</p>
        <p>My action sheds some fright -</p>
        <p>My words as good as mud:</p>
        <br>
        <p>Of all desire's objects,</p>
        <p>the total sum is youth - </p>
        <p>the vitality of everlasting life - </p>
        <p>but only one fountain provides the truth...</p>
        <br>
        <p>The same old lie deceives even to this day:</p>
        <p>Spoken from the one who is set to steal, destroy, and kill - </p>

        <p>Confounded in the midst</p>
        <p>Confused by the mist</p>
        <p>Of war</p>
        <p>Of greatness</p>

        <p>And on the cusp of this most peculiar stroll in life,</p>

        <p>Somewhere there was an animal within me, a beast</p>
        <p>At all times my surroundings beg adoration, a feast</p>
        <p>Her and her angelic demons, the greyness warrants my kill</p>
        <p>The beauty of my better half forces me to feel</p>
        <br>
        <p>People chirp less when they don't feel blessed</p>
        <p>Even though at our core we all want Simplicity: what's best</p>
        <p>Multiplication outweighs subtraction</p>
        <p>And focus prevails distraction</p>
        <br>
        <p>If faith and belief are words that scare</p>
        <p>Then imagine a synonym that your heart can bear</p>
        <p>For belief begets definition</p>
        <p>And definition yields progress,</p>
        <p>Progress begets change</p>
        <p>And Change gives birth to Life!</p>

        <p>I speak these symbols for your future emotion,</p>
        <p>In hope that bright fulfillment will outdo blind commotion.</p>
        <p>So while you find yourself in this most peculiarly wrinkled world,</p>
        <p>Unravel the map of your heart, and run one way - </p>
        <p>To where there lies no beastly misery</p>
        <p>To the cookie jar on top of the fridge, its flavors a mystery</p>

    <p>***</p>
    <p>Do you have the eyes to see the answer to the riddle of life?</p>
    <p>No, I mean can you see the music around you? The notes within you and the chords outside you?</p>
    <p>NO. I'm saying - Do you even realize how beautiful being is? How glorious it is to be on top of the mountain, not bothering the hike up nor the way down?</p>
    <p>NOOOOOOOOOOO. Not even close. Every fiber of your being can become <i>knit</i> with love - the righteous and true kind.</p>
    <p>Here's your first clue to the riddle: <i>The answer is better than what you can imagine.</i></p>
    <p>And here's your final clue:</p>
    <p>Do you have the ears to hear the glory of the jungle?</p>
    <p>A lion roars, and the full range of experience echoes with satisfaction throughout the jungle.</p>
    <p>A torrential downpour of words like weaponry comes forth from the mouth of the lion.</p>
    <p>Like a waterfall that takes its unsuspecting victim to the salty sea bottom.</p>
    <p>Desolate for a moment.</p>
    <p>Rushing under, and then solemnly floating to the ocean floor.</p>
    <p>Then, a brisk and desperate gasp for air.</p>
    <p>At the bottom again, millstones cascading around you.</p>
    <p>But there are only guns to inhale here, because you are in deep water, and every molecule is a word that penetrates the mind.</p>
    <p>But there is a problem, for there is a limitation.</p>
    <p>Though the words be real, and their intention good, and their sound solid to the soul.</p>
    <p>All the roaring does is dig into the mind.</p>
    <p>Where what is needed is a snakebite of real truth to the heart.</p>
    <p>You gotta feel the fangs sink into your very own soul, and survive the sting of the venom.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>No, only one Word can do that.</p>
    <p>And He is mentioned here or there.</p>
    <p>But He must strike you in the heart, and at His precise moment, for you to ever breathe under water.</p>
    <p>Because if you do not know Him, it is like you are unconscious, at the bottom of the ocean, unaware of how when you take your next true breath, you are either going to drown in darkness having denied Him, or breathe because of His grace and light and truth and power.</p>
    <p>Right now, the Lord of all creation is saying, through His Word, the Holy Bible, no doubt, "I have made a path from me to you, and it is available to any who believe in my Son, through trusting in the shed blood of my very own Son which has the power to cover your iniquity and your sins against me."</p>
    <p>You probably know his name as Jesus Christ, who is the Word of God, the Son of God, the Lamb of God who was slain so that we could be with God.</p>
    <p>May the truth of the Word be poured out on any who believe they have no sin, on any who disregard God, or His message, His truth, His being, on any who deny His love and how He has paved the way for everyone's salvation and any who say God is someone who He is not, or any who believe they have not done evil in the sight of the Lord of all creation, who surely sees and knows all things, actions, thoughts, and everything else.</p>
    <p>For if you don't yet realize that you are evil without the Lord, and if you do not believe you are a sinner, a law breaker, a rebellious and stiff-necked creation that is set to do your own will over the will of the only one who is good...That's when you know you are still deep behind enemy lines.</p>
    <p>For the reason of the actions of the cross are this:</p>
    <p>Do we not all know, for such is a law of life, <i>In order for something to <b>live</b>, something else must <b>die</b>?</i></p>
    <p>Truly, because the Son of God chose to die for our sake, those who believe in Him will live with God in the kingdom to come, which will be everlasting.</p>
    <p>Do we not all know, for such is a law of life, <i>In order to clean something, something else must become dirty?</i></p>
      <p>Truly, because the Son of God chose to become dirty for our sake, because He obeyed the Father and put on all of the filth of the world though He himself was pure and innocent and righteous, those who believe in Him are made clean before the sight of God.</p>
    <p>Now we know, unless the Spirit of God does indeed dwell within you, you are spiritually unconscious. You are spiritually drowning and you don't know it. Deep down, your soul is parched because the world has trained you to survive on what is the spiritual equivalent of dog food and feces. You are so locked into your own prescribed tribes and routines of comfort that make you feel sane and valuable, accepted and appreciated. I know. I get it. I was there too.</p>
    <p><i>I'm screamin' at you, right now, though:</i></p>
    <p><b>THERE IS A FEAST FOR YOUR SPIRIT LIKE YOU WOULD NOT BELEIVE IF YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS CHRIST.</b></p>
    <p><i>And I want you to know, because of how wonderful you are and how valuable your soul is:</i></p>
    <p><b>THERE WILL COME A DAY WHEN CREATION WILL BE JUDGED BY GOD.</p>
      <p>ONE SIDE WILL INHERIT LIFE AND LIGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE CLEAN, MADE RIGHTEOUS BY THE BLOOD OF THE SON OF GOD, JESUS CHRIST, WHO TRULY DID DIE SO THAT THE WORLD MIGHT BE SAVED, AND WAS RAISED ON THE THIRD DAY, THEREBY DEFEATING DEATH, AND SHOWING HOW ALL THOSE WITH HIM WILL DEFEAT DEATH AND INHERIT ETERNAL LIFE.</p>
      <p>BUT THOSE WHO DENY JESUS CHRIST, THE SAVIOR FOR MANKIND WHICH GOD LOVINGLY SENT TO ALL SO THAT THEY MAY ACCEPT HIM AND BE SAVED, WILL INHERIT HOPELESSNESS AND DARKNESS BECAUSE THEY REMAIN DIRTY - AND TO BE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD, ONE MUST BE PERFECTLY CLEAN - SO, REMAINING FILTHY, GOD WILL CAST THEM INTO OUTER DARKNESS, AWAY FROM HIS HOLY PRESENCE.</b></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>The Holy Bible speaks truth yet again right here, in Proverbs 9:36:</p>
    <p><b>"But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death."</b></p>
    <p><i>By not loving God in word and in action, in our hearts and in our minds, we are loving death, because the truth is that God <b>is</b> life.</i></p>
      <p>God is life. God is who has given you life, freely. And he has given you eternal life freely too, if only you could summon the faith to accept what Jesus did for you as sufficient, trusting wholly in God's righteousness, not your own, to save you.</p>
      <p>Your spirit is either washed in the blood of Jesus, made clean and perfect in the eyes of God...or your spirit is dirty with all of the evil you have seen, thought, done, and reveled in across the course of your life.</p>
      <p>Accept Jesus Christ before that day of judgment.</p>
      <p>The Bible tells us that everything will change in the blink of an eye, and that the world will be totally oblivious up until that momentous change.</p>
      <p>Don't be counted among the oblivious. Don't be counted among the dirty. Don't be counted among the spiritually dead, which according to God, is the equivalent of a walking zombie.</p>
      <p>So, in a dark but nonetheless true way, the world is filled with zombies right now, spiritually dead people who have no life in them, because they do not know nor love the only true source of life and goodness.</p>
      <p>And for people who still cannot summon any faith in Jesus Christ as God, and commit their life to Him, I would just urge you to read the following story and realize that this will be you, if you do not believe in God when even a man was raised from the dead!</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p><u>The Rich Man and the Beggar</u></p>
      <p><u>Luke 16:19-31</u></p>
      <p><b>There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</p>
        <p>And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</p>
        <p>And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</p>
        <p>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</p>
        <p>And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</p>
        <p>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</p>
        <p>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</p>
        <p>And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that <i>would come</i> from thence.</p>
        <p>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:</p>
        <p>For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</p>
        <p>Abraham saith unto him, THEY HAVE MOSES AND THE PROPHETS; LET THEM HEAR THEM.</p>
        <p>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</p>
        <p>And he said unto him, IF THEY HEAR NOT MOSES AND THE PROPHETS, NEITHER WILL THEY BE PERSUADED, THOUGH ONE ROSE FROM THE DEAD.</p></b>

      <p>Don't be this rich dude, who neglected Moses, the prophets, and Jesus Christ, the man who literally rose from the dead. Come to Jesus and for the sake of your well-being, for the sake of your very own soul, <i><b>believe</b></i> Him.</p>

      <p>***</p>

      <p><u>God's Wrath Against Ungodliness</u></p>
      <p><u>Romans 1:18-32</u></p>
      <p><b>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</p>
        <p>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <i>it</i> unto them.</p>
        <p>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <i>even</i> his eternal power and God-head; so that they are without excuse:</p>
        <p>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <i>him</i> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</p>
        <p>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</p>
        <p>And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.</p>
        <p>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</p>
        <p>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
        <p>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</p>
        <p>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</p>
        <p>And even as they did not like to retain God in <i>their</i> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</p>
        <p>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</p>
        <p>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</p>
        <p>Without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</p>
        <p>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</p></b>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>I'm telling you - the Bible and the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ <i>is</i> God's hand reaching down to all of mankind and saying...<b>Believe in my Son and you will be saved.</b></p>
      <p>The Bible and who it is all about - Jesus - is God's plan for salvation.</p>
      <p>But does it not show the evil of mankind, how many of us choose to reject God and His free gift of salvation?</p>
      <p>It is free. It is a gift. And all we have to do is tell God we accept the gift and genuinely believe Jesus is the Son of God and that His blood covers us.</p>
      <p>I'm here to tell you: <i>Grab on. While you still can. Grab on to the outreaching graceful hand of God and be saved in the name of Jesus.</i></p>
      <p>Because there is a day when He removes His hand, the world drastically changes, and evil, evil things take place for a short time.</p>
      <p>Be saved before this. You have been warned.</p>
      <p>It is so easy to get saved. Admit the truth which is that you are a sinner, in need of a Savior, and tell God that you trust in His plan and work for your salvation - the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Ask him to enter your heart and change you for good, and though we are evil beyond what we can understand, <i>His love is so great that if we just ask in honesty and in the name of seeking truth and righteousness, He will give us everything</i>.
        <p>And at the end of history, the Bible will be a testament against all who reject God, a perfect case showing how God pursued mankind fervently and with steadfast and gracious love, but many people reject Him and do not repent of their ways and sins.</p>
        <p>And the Bible will be a testament for all who believe in the one and true way God provides to Him - through the holy blood of Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>There are two sides to this spiritual war taking place on earth.</p>
        <p>You are either with God through Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>Or you are with the enemy, against Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>Take a wild guess at which side wins in the end.</p>
        <p>Come to Jesus.</p>

        <p>***</p>
        <p><u>Walk in Love</u></p>
        <p><u>Ephesians 5:1-14</u></p>
        <p><b>Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;</p>
          <p>And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</p>
          <p>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</p>
          <p>Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</p>
          <p>For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
          <p>Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</p>
          <p>Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</p></b>
          <p><u>Walk as Children of Light</u></p>
          <p><b>For ye were sometimes darkness, but now <i>are ye</i> light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</p>
            <p>(For the fruit of the Spirit <i>is</i> in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)</p>
            <p>Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove <i>them</i>.</p>
            <p>For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</p>
            <p>But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</p>
            <p><i>WHEREFORE HE SAITH, AWAKE THOU THAT SLEEPEST, AND ARISE FROM THE DEAD, AND CHRIST SHALL GIVE THEE LIGHT.</i></p></b>

              <p>Jesus is risen. And the world <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF7mkyd-Wm4" target="_blank"><b>cannot</b></a> believe it, because the world does not want its evil exposed. The world and all of us before knowing Christ want our evil kept in the dark. But little do we know that keeping it there will only lead our soul to the same darkness in the end. Come to Jesus, and let His glorious light outshine all of your sins. I know it's tempting to keep to your ways because you do not see the punishment you incur and the wrath of God you cause by doing what you do. But one day we all will. Let us walk with God, and let Him baptize us with His Holy Spirit, so that we may be counted as righteous on that judgment day, so that we may be forgiven and may inherit eternal life with the Lord of all creation, so that we may, by the grace of God alone, escape the horror and torment that is set for people who have no faith, who cannot see the evil that they are and that they do, and who fail to repent and turn to God, the only source of light in this world, an evil world which is desperately trying to deceive all of its inhabitants into darkness, and clearly succeeding with many.
              </p>
            <p>***</p>
          <p>The stakes are high. The grace of God is great. But unless you accept His free gift of salvation through Jesus Christ, and become spiritually covered by the grace and will of God...you go where an evil human being deserves to go - to hell. And hell is <i>eternal</i>. Because consequences of action are <i>real and last forever</i>.</p>
          <p>Man. I love you so much.</p>
          <p>I may not even know you, but I love you. Because I know the good Lord created you. And I know you are so like me, whether you know it or not, caught in this same storyline, playing around on this same wonderful earth filled with so many wonderful things to do and amazing people and awesome places to see. It really is somethin, isn't it?</p>
          <p>But I'm screamin at you here - I'm in your face, shaking your shoulders, slapping you so you might wake up, yelling in your ear so that you can't say you didn't hear it from me, trying to get you to see this, trying to get you to believe the truth about reality when I know it's so hard and you don't want to believe because we learn to love the lies we are raised on...But you gotta see reality for what it is - because it puts everything in perspective of truth - how we are in the middle of a long and chaotic and very real and fascinating spiritual war between quite literally the epitome of good and the epitome of evil.</p>
          <p>And the movie is about to cut to the final scene. And it's gonna be out of this world, what goes down in the end.</p>
          <p>Come to Jesus. Get saved. Join the army of the light - it wins in the end.</p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>What a beautiful moment it is when you begin to realize just how much greater the epitome of good is despite the vain show of tragic and pitiful pride the epitome of evil can't shake...</p>

          <p><i>Listen to my words as best as you can: If you do not know the truth and if you are not seeking the truth every moment, you are spiritually consuming lies of the world and in the process of being led astray by the evil which truly does blind the whole world.</i></p>
          <p><i><b>If you honestly in your heart want to know the truth...then ask God. Ask God to reveal the truth to you. And He will, if the actual truth is what you want.</i></p>
            <p>***</p>
            <p>But many people do not want to know the truth...</p>
            <p>...it could be because to admit that they are in the wrong before God and others, and understanding that God has been in the right this whole time is too much for their ego...</p>
            <p>...it could be because they don't think they've done anything wrong (this is probably the most tragic condition of sin...a person who is so blind spiritually that they do not believe they have transgressed against the God who has given them every good thing)...</p>
            <p>...it could be because they claim to not believe in God - but the Bible speaks truth yet again on this - God has put eternity in the heart of man and we all know there is more to life than the physical summation of atoms, and truly, truly, it takes a fool who is in the deep thickness of the world to say in their heart "There is no God!"...</p>
            <p>...it could be because they love their life rather than God (even if in reality they are living inside a lie, inevitably contrary to the truth until you are made right with it) and getting to live their life on their terms is so important to them, that no part of them would ever want the truth because they fear the change it would cause to what they want and get in life...</p>
            </b></p>
          <p>Regardless of what it is, in the end, you have either chosen God and the real and lasting good life, only available by the blood of Jesus Christ...or you have tragically fallen for a deceitful lie that you loved more than the truth...and the truth says He will not tolerate forever someone who, when given life, uses it to love lies and false living, rejecting the ultimate and pure truth.</p>
          <p>And you have no room to complain in the end if you fail to choose God. The Bible says the Lord put everyone in their respective place and respective time on earth so that they would have the opportunity to seek Him. <i>He gives everyone plenty of time to repent from evil and lies and falsehood and turn to good and life and actual love...no one will have a legitimate excuse. He is more than fair with all of us, and a truly merciful and loving God...It only shows the stubborn self-centeredness of the heart of man that we don't see God for who He is in this regard...Do you understand? Do you hear? Do you see? God has given us everything - He has given us Himself - GOD DIED. FOR YOU. AND NOW HE LIVES FOREVER AND EVER. But you don't believe, for complicated personal and internal reasons I imagine. Pray that they are good enough reasons when your soul confronts God in the end.</p>
          </i><p>***</p>
          <p><i>Guess who wins in the end! We all know it in our heart. Good wins. The good side wins. God wins in the end. God is good.</i></p>
          <p>Join the good side. Join the army of the light. Give your life to Jesus Christ. Stop swimming in murky water over there, TRAPPED IN A VICIOUS CYCLE OF SPIRITUALLY NUMBING YOURSELF WITH DOG FOOD AND FECES WHEN THERE IS A GOD-GIVEN HOLY AND RIGHTEOUS AND AWESOME FEAST AVAILABLE ALWAYS AND FOREVER IF YOU COULD ONLY BELIEVE IN THE TRUTH - IF YOU COULD ONLY COMMIT WHOLLY TO JESUS IN ALL THAT YOU DO, TURNING TO GOD IN ALL THAT YOU DO, SUBMITTING TO GOD IN ALL OF YOUR WAYS.</p>
          <p>But I know what it's like to struggle doing that. I still struggle doing that, trapped in this flesh wrapped around me. But God has saved me from this body of death. And He will save you too, if only you have faith in Him! And because I have accepted Christ into my life, and chosen to make Him the true center of my life, though I still fall and fail and am not enough and never was enough and never will be enough, because He knows me now, HE IS ENOUGH. Even when I am weak and I have been weak often, HE IS WITH ME AND HE IS STRONG.</p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>...Are you listening? Are you hearing all of this or is it just going to bounce off your brain and you're going to return to what you know and like to do on your own? I say this with as much love as possible. Don't. Don't do anything unless it is with Christ. I'm here to tell you, and I'll be saying it until the Lord lets me breathe my last breath on this awful and sinful earth, <i><b>Anything that you do apart from Christ is complete and utter vanity. All the ways of man are vanity and this will be clear to everyone in the end. Only the way of God is what stands forever. Amen.</p></i></b>
            <p>Jump on the only train which will take you to where you really want to go - get to know and love the way of God - which is Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>More crucial truth from the Bible:</p>
            <p><u>John 14:1-7</u></p>
            <p><b>Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.</p>
              <p>In my Father's house are many mansions: if <i>it were</i> not <i>so</i>, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</p>
              <p>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, <i>there</i> ye may be also.</p>
              <p>And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.</p>
              <p>Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?</p>
              <p>Jesus saith unto him, I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE: NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER, BUT BY ME.</p>
              <p>If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.</p></b>
            <p>***</p>
            <p>...</p>
          <p>When you can see clearly how hell is real - not some joke where all the fun people go but serious and awful and desolate, how heaven is real - not some cartoonish cloudy place but a kingdom greater than human conception, how the many ways to hell are paved with good intentions - people thinking the way they live is right and fine, how the only way to heaven is through truth, how Jesus Christ really is the only truth in a world packed full of lies...as fun as it is to joke and jest and play around on the surface of life...when you understand to a certain extent how deep truth goes, and how deep the lies go, and how pervasive and evil deception is throughout the earth...things start to get more serious than you ever imagined possible. Things start to actually get real. Because now you see what matters. And you see what is at stake.</p>
          <p>Everything is what is at stake. All of our souls, all of our very beings are what is at stake. And all who deny Christ, deny the salvation of their soul.</p>
          <p>When you spiritually wake up, looking back, how you were asleep makes zero sense. The gift of God's salvation for us in Christ Jesus, <i>is</i> <b>free</b>, but so many people cannot come to believe it. Eternal life given to any who can confess the truth of their serial imperfection, and how the perfection and love of God and Jesus is so great that it can cover all of your imperfection, <i>if only you simply acknowledge and believe this truth</i>.
            <p>But I suppose that is a symptom of the mystery of iniquity. In retrospect, it becomes obvious how Jesus is the righteous answer to all unrighteousness, how, in a manner of speaking, Jesus is God's perfect answer to everything about this world...</p>
            <p>But people cannot believe for some reason, and so perpetuate their unrighteous doing, spine-chillingly blind to their own wickedness, still not covered by truth, still wrapped up in the lies of the world.</p>
            <p>And the enemy has become talented at telling many convincing lies. So many lies that we all believe, until the truth, who is Jesus Christ, sets us free.</p>
          <p>Because you finally see and understand how all of reality as we know it is one cosmic chess match, between light and dark, between day and night.</p>
          <p>And you see how amazingly valuable every individual human being is, and how it is the will of the darkness to win souls to its side, and the will of the light to win souls to its side.</p>
          <p>But there are rules to the game. The soul has to choose of its own volition. Darkness is permitted to dance and deceive to a certain extent, but at the end of the day, it is a matter of the heart, it is a choice of one's own soul whether it is aligned with the Day, or a creature of the Night, whether it chooses to be good and follow God, or to be evil and follow the Devil.</p>
          <p>And by this simple choice we all make at some point in our lives and continually day by day, we are either justified or condemned. We serve righteousness or wickedness. We serve the light or we serve the darkness. We serve the good or we serve the evil. We serve the Day, or we serve the Night.</p>
          <p>And right now we are in between, pieces on the chess board that is the earth, and there's both light and dark here. And the earth switches between Day and Night, Night and Day.</p>
          <p>But so does the Bible foretell, and with a godly precision no doubt...</p>
          <p>At the end of this chess game...</p>
          <p>When the pieces have all chosen their fate...</p>
          <p>When the players have all revealed what they put their faith in...</p>
          <p>God says "Enough! Game over!"</p>
          <p>And then those with God inherit and go to the place where it is forever Day.</p>
          <p>And then those who rejected God and listened to the Devil and loved his lies more than the truth inherit and go to the place where it is forever Night.</p>
          <p>***</p>

          <p>I imagine it probably sounds pretty wild to someone who is spiritually unconscious.</p>
          <p>But I literally cannot stress all these words from the very mouth of Jesus Christ enough:</p>
          <p><u>Matthew 16:25-27</u></p>
          <p><b>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</p>
          <p>For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</p>
          <p>For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.</p></b>

          <p>This won't be the last time I'll say it on here: Come to Jesus Christ, my friend, and soon, for His return is soon - much, much, sooner than you want to believe if you don't know Him.</p>
    <p>You must do this for you to ever dwell where He dwells.</p>
    <p>And all the Word is saying right now is this:</p>
    <p><b>I love you. More than you could ever conceive of. Now show me faith, and I will show you what real life and real love is.</b></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Will you trust the truth of the Word or will you fall for false idols and imposters?</p>
    <p>Pray with me right now:</p>
    <p><i>Dear Lord of all creation,</p>
    <p> I want you and nothing else. I want you to tackle me with your truth. I want you to bruise me and beat me and wreck me in this world if it leads to me getting to be with you forever and understand you and the truth more. Because people need to know about you and your love and how great you are. And they don't because they're confused and so they latch on to what they can and so they don't know what they really should do, except for what they've been told is right to do, and what is told is so often traceable back to what is truly worldly and vain advice. Lord, I pray that people would have the courage and faith to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBE2hr5q25g&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw&index=21" target="_blank"><b>ask</b></a> you themselves if you exist and if you are real and that you would answer them - and they would begin to see you and your glory and how wonderful it all is. God, give us clarity and understanding in our hearts, and a love for others like you have. May we be beacons of light in this world that cultivates darkness, and may all we do and all we say be glorifying to you.
    </p>
    <p>Amen.</i></p>
    <p>The water may be deeper than it's ever been.</p>
    <p>But in the end, all that will be left is His love.</p>
    <p>But until then, this water is deep. Jesus, rescue me.</p>

    <p>Listen:</p>
    <p>I was walking down an old dirt road.</p>
    <p>Stuck in a town where I didn't even belong in the first place.</p>
    <p>It was then that a bunch of townsmen appeared from the darkness and they confronted me there on the trail heading out of town and they surrounded me on all sides.</p>
    <p>One had a shovel - he was a gravedigger.</p>
    <p>I said to the townsmen, "To what do I owe the honor?"</p>
    <p>And the gravedigger reared back his shovel, ready to strike me down, and replied:</p>
    <p>"Your very breath is a threat to our comfort here in this town."</p>
    <p>I continued to breathe and a brief thought crossed my mind concerning birds and cages and fowlers and freedom -
    <p>"Hold on," I said, buying myself some time. "Before you kill me, let me get this down on paper."</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SHDNs7Dt5M" target="_blank"><b>God</b></a> is infinitely gracious but repeatedly reveals He will not tolerate sin forever."</p>
    <p>"Circumstances in the world constantly change, even situations and relationships that appear solid. Reliable industries weaken, companies are sold, and careers are lost; health deteriorates, life changes drastically, and loved ones die."</p>
    <p>"You only get so much time to live, and then - ready or not - it's over. One of the truly certain things about life is that it will end. Far better than living in denial about the fact that our lives will end is facing up to it and living in light of it. The only people who are truly ready to live are those who are prepared to die."</p>
    <p>"The devil wants to steal your power and neutralize your impact. His goal is to trick you with the trivial and get you to spend your life focused on the superficial, so that you are kept from your calling and deprived of your destiny. If he can keep your attention diverted until you are dead, he will be able to get you to do to yourself what he doesn't have the power to do to you. His endgame is to play the fiddle while the life you were meant to live goes up in smoke."</p>
    <p>"The reason why man will never find something that makes him happy apart from God, the reason why this will never succeed is because God made us: invented us as a man invents an engine. A car is made to run on petrol, and it would not run properly on anything else. Now God designed the human machine to run on Himself. He Himself is the fuel our spirits were designed to feed on. There is no other. That is why it is just no good asking God to make us happy in our own way without bothering about religion. God cannot give us happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there. There is no such thing."</p>
    <p>"Our union with Him brings us satisfaction and fulfillment which the world cannot comprehend. This is the fulfillment of the purpose for which we were created. Everything pertaining to life and godliness is provided for us in Christ. We can only be fulfilled by Him. Every perversion of human nature is caused by man's attempt to find fulfillment and security outside of Christ. This only leads to dissatisfaction and insecurity."</p>
    <p>"Prosperity knits a man to the World. He feels that he is 'finding his place in it', while really it is finding its place in him. His increasing reputation, his widening circle of acquaintances, his sense of importance, the growing pressure of absorbing and agreeable work, build up in him a sense of being really at home in earth, which is just what we demons want."</p>
    <p>"A counterfeit god is anything so central and essential to your life that, should you lose it, your life would feel hardly worth living. An idol has such a controlling position in your heart that you can spend most of your passion and energy, your emotional and financial resources, on it without a second thought. It can be family or children, or career and making money, or achievement and critical acclaim, or saving "face" and social standing. It can be a romantic relationship, peer approval, competence and skill, secure and comfortable circumstances, your beauty or your brains, a great political or social cause, your morality or virtue, or even success in the Christian ministry...An idol is whatever you look at and say, in your heart of hearts, "If I have that, then I'll feel my life has meaning, then I'll know I have value, then I'll feel significant and secure."</p>
    <p>"Jesus's parable answers the question that Dinesen's story poses so skillfully. Jesus says, "I am the Bread of Heaven." Jesus tells us that both the sensual way of the younger brother and the ethical way of the elder brother are spiritual dead ends. He also shows us there is another way: through him. And to enter that way and to live a life based on his salvation will bring us finally to the ultimate party and feast at the end of history. We can have a foretaste of that future salvation now in all the ways outlined in this chapter: in prayer, in service to others, in the changes in our inner nature through the gospel, and through the healed relationships that Christ can give us now. But they are only a foretaste of what is to come."</p>
    <p>"'When I ask you tonight if you are a Christian, many of you will answer and say you joined a church.' He practically screamed: 'Joining a church won't make you a Christian any more than joining the Lions' Club will make you a lion!' His words began to penetrate. 'From the day you were born, you wanted to 'do your own thing' and you were rebellious against God. If you want to really know God, you've got to repent of this rebellion, which the Bible calls <i>sin</i>...Religion is not the answer! <i>Salvation is</i>! Salvation is committing your life to Jesus Christ and believing in Him. But don't think you are going to use Jesus for a passport to heaven. If you confess Him, you must believe He is God's only son who was sent to die for your sins...It's possible to be a deacon, an elder, a steward, a Sunday-school teacher, or go to a church all your life and not know the Lord."</p>

    <p>I know the content of this website is <i>just a <h6>little</h6> bit</i> longer than a tweet.</p>
    <p>And I know you have a lot of important routines going on and things to do in your life...</p>

    <p>But the truth is how you respond to the information here will affect the rest of your life (and then some).</p>
    <p>Because...</p>
    <p><u>Proverbs 14:12</u></p>
    <p><b><i>There is a way which seemeth right to a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.</i></b></p>
    <p>And that is the way of the world - because the world rejects the truth of the only one who holds the keys to life...</p>
    <p><u>John 5:24</u></p>
    <p><b><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</i></b></p>
    <p>Jesus Christ is the way to <i>everlasting</i> life, and there is a grand spiritual deception at work in the world right now - as you and I breathe - that is out to hide this truth.</p>
    <p><u>1 Corinthians 1:18</u></p>
    <p><b><i>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</i></b></p>

    <p>Do you understand that?^</p>

    <p><i>The preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness.</i></p>
    <p><b><i>But unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</i></b></p>

    <p>I cannot stress this enough:</p>
    <p>It would do your soul well to pursue Jesus with an honest and open heart...</p>
    <p>And understand for yourself:</p>
    <p>What is foolishness <i>really</i>?</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>Who is God <i>really</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Whatever you do, don't dismiss it outright. Don't return to the mundane just because it's easier and simpler to. Don't revert to the mindless familiar because it is what you know. Be mindful of your time and how fleeting it really is. You need to wrestle with truth, and you will, sooner or later. It is a lot better to do so now, because as of this writing we are in a period of time where God is instituting His grace over the earth. Soon, that will stop. Wrestle with the truth now. Not later. Not tomorrow. Not next week. NOW! Your future depends on it...</i></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>This is <b>the</b> most important question for every human being RIGHT NOW:</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p><h3>Who is Jesus Christ to you?</h3></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p><i>I'm really trying to save you a lot of time and a lot of pain and a lot of heartache here.</i></p>
    <p>But sadly, as you can probably agree with, human beings prefer to walk by sight and not by faith.</p>
    <p>Which means, unfortunately for my desire for you to be saved, but fortunately for the beauty of reality, all of my words here will not affect you nearly as much as a real life experience you have.</p>
    <p>So in accordance with the folly of human nature, I say the following:</p>
    <p>Spoiler alert - I promise you knowing Jesus Christ is the epitome of human experience. That is all this website really is. I want you to share in the joy and truth and honor and beauty and wonder and awesomeness of coming to know the Lord of all creation, Jesus Christ, who has such a deep and rich love for you that if you felt it, you would drop to your knees and fall on your face in awe of His power. And then walking in relationship with Jesus leads to some other-worldly joy for life, peace no matter what, and the deepest love for what is good. It's really just so freaking awesome. And I want you to know this awesomeness - I want you to know the Lord for so many reasons - but mainly because He wants to know you, and He is so good to those that know Him.</p>

    <p>You have to have faith in Him though. At least right now, in this period of grace. He wants you to be faithful to Him. If it feels like you don't know Him, it's because of two things:</p>
    <p>1. <b>You are lacking faith.</b> This means that you don't really believe in "all that Jesus crap" - you don't believe Jesus or what He did for you or how much He loves you. Jesus is a minor character in your life, if a character at all. Maybe you really doubt Jesus is God or you think the true bible is unreliable, but either way, your doubts that you have about God rule your actions, not your genuine faith in Him.</p>
    <p>2. <b>You want something from this world more than Him.</b> Maybe it is money. Maybe it is sex. Maybe it is success or a good reputation. Probably a combination of all three. Probably what it is on some level, as it is for everyone who wars with the flesh, is a want for personal glory and personal power for selfish gratification. Regardless of what it is, it is something other than the Lord. We all have idols that seek to replace the part in our lives that the Lord is meant for. We all have idols that we really try to get to fulfill us, but nothing ever will fulfill the human spirit as completely as the Lord. Think about what you spend your money on. Think about what you spend your time on. If you worship an idol other than the Lord - if the Lord is not the sole priority in your life, then do not expect to know Him or feel known by Him. Because your heart is not set on Him, it is set on other things beside Him. What the Lord wants you to see and understand is Him and His love and His goodness, and when you start to understand these things, you start to see how mysteriously amazing He is, and that connection you have with Him drives real spiritual change in your life. How do you expect to come to understand Him when something of the world is so clearly to Him more important than He is to you?
    </p>

    <p>So I tell you all this stuff because it is my hope that you can come to know Him before the next age on earth happens - and that is right around the corner. It is going to be a period of "great tribulation" on the earth - a time of great trouble and horror because the world has rejected the truth and bought a lie. It is going to be an awful and fearful time to be on earth. I want you to be saved and to not have to go through all the madness that will soon happen. I want to be next to you in heaven by the presence of the Lord.</p>
    <p>But, and rightfully so, I'm only in charge of me and my soul. And it is all up to you as to what you trust in and what you choose to believe, and where your soul goes.</p>
    <p>This website is my nicest way of screaming in your ear: <i>Hey! Believe in Jesus and you will have <b>eternal life</b>. And you will be saved from so much horror...</i></p>
    <p>I want you to be there in the kingdom of God, having served the King of creation and not yourself and the imposter who truly does deceive the whole world.</p>

    <p>Anyway. Blah blah blah blah. The point is, it'd be awesome if you could summon the faith to accept what Jesus Christ did for you before this new age happens. Because when this new age happens, when this "new world order" that is already on its way and we can see the beginning of it now - when that <i>really</i> kicks into gear, it's a whole nother ballgame. I've provided some sources at the bottom of this page to help anyone who happens to find themselves left behind on the earth in those new age days. It's going to be so bad. Like truly and terrifyingly awful. Come to Jesus before then.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>In fact, I feel compelled to write about these new age days more, because I feel so heavily how right around the corner they are. A false light - the antichrist - is going to come on the scene in those days - a man that will woo the heart of the world and the vast majority of the world will be deceived and worship this man because he accomplishes great things and performs great wonders. But he is false, he is a lie. He is the false light that loves to trick men into pursuing darkness rather than the light.</p>
    <p>Very soon America will be attacked, something will occur much stronger and more destructive than what occurred on September 11, 2001, something likely involving the detonation of nuclear weapons, at least but not limited to within close proximity of New York City.</p>
    <p>Other horrors are set to befall the United States of America, and the entire world, and for lack of a better term, World War III occurs...in one day, everything will change. This day has been planned by the elites of the world and has been in the making for a long time - they will orchestrate it with remarkable quickness, catching almost everyone off guard.</p>
    <p>Don't be caught off guard. If you don't die the day World War III begins, there is a huge chance you will die violently in the months and years to come, for a time.</p>
    <p>If you are reading this, come to Jesus before it all so you can escape this mess. If you genuinely accept Him into your heart, no thing will snatch you out of His good hand.</p>
    <p>World War III occurs, but it is more important to realize why World War III occurs and was orchestrated by the elite rulers of the earth...</p>
    <p>It is all one gigantic theatrical display of deception.</p>
    <p>This is their goal:</p>
    <p>Cripple you and your faith, cripple and dismantle any connection you previously had to truth in Jesus Christ alone. If you don't die in the crossfire, they want to hurt you so badly if not physically, then on a psychological and spiritual level so that you <i>willingly accept whatever the new world order and the new world leader proposes for you to do</i>. What they want is you to trust them, the world, and the world leader who will come on the scene and "solve" the issue of World War III and promise peace for a time, claiming a new era of profound peace and love is about to happen on earth. It is going to be so tempting to trust and follow this man because the whole world will be deceived and follow what this new world order promises, because the world will get chaotic like you never imagined it could be for a time, and people will be desperate for that sense of comfort and sense of security we have all grown to love and covet so much...DO NOT ACCEPT WHATEVER THE WORLD PROPOSES TO MEND THE BROKENNESS OF THE WORLD AFTER THE HORRORS OF WORLD WAR III. WHOEVER IT WILL BE, THEY WILL SAY MANY CONVINCING LIES, PROMISING PEACE AND LOVE. BUT, THIS FALSEHOOD THAT THIS MAN IS AND THAT THE WORLD LOVES IN REALITY WILL LEAD TO THE FURTHEST HORRORS FROM PEACE. FOR THE SAKE OF THE ETERNITY OF YOUR SOUL, TRUST IN JESUS CHRIST AND THE HOLY BIBLE.
    </p>
    <p>Be aware that this will be Satan's last hoorah at ruling the earth, as literally as it has been for awhile, and he is going to pull so many tricks and use up all the lies he has - and these tricks and traps and lies and horrific deceiving signs are going to succeed with <b>so many people</b>. He is going to twist scripture as best as he can, as he has done since holy scripture was first communicated. He is going to promise some form of eternal life, like the true God does to His true followers. He is going to promise peace and love and tickle people's ears with wonderful words and impress people so deeply with what he does and accomplishes. DO NOT TRUST IN THIS FALSE SAVIOR WHICH WILL SURELY WOO THE HEART OF MANY. TRUST IN THE TRUE LORD GOD OF ALL CREATION, WHO CAME IN THE FORM OF MAN AS JESUS CHRIST, AND DIED ON THE CROSS TO BEAR THE SINS OF THE WORLD SO THAT THE WORLD MIGHT BE SAVED BY BELIEVING ON HIM.</p>
    <p>Be careful to not forget the substance of my words on here - your belief in them could affect whether you inherit hell or heaven.</p>
    <p>Trust God and the Holy Bible, not the world and its wide array of falsehood.</p>
    <p>Come to know the true light before the false light gets his appointed time to shine for a short while...</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>And the true light of the world is none other than JESUS CHRIST.</p>
    <p>Not Christianity. Not Christians. Not good deeds. Not good feelings. Not comfort. Not laughter. Not "memories". Not some unidentifiable, undefinable, unknowable love. THE love and THE light that is destined to satisfy our soul in total fullness is Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>It's not about religion (man trying to attain holiness and righteousness by himself) - it never was. It's about carefully and lovingly cultivating a relationship with your Creator, and your Creator has revealed His character and message in Christ.</p>
    <p>But how will you even have a relationship with your Creator if you do not believe in Him?</p>
    <p>The Holy Bible reads, the perfect book which the Lord gave us to understand Him and His exposing mankind for the evil that it is, the Book of John reads:</p>
    <p><u>John 3:12</u></p>
    <p><b>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</p>
      <p>And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</p>
      <p>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</p>
      <p>That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</p>
      <p><i><u>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</i></u></p>
      <p>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</p>
      <p>He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</p>
      <p>For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</p>
      <p>But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</p>

    <p>Something of global significance is going to happen soon.</p>
    <p>The world is going to try to explain it away with a lie.</p>
    <p>And then one man is going to rise to immense power and control much of the world.</p>
    <p>And then basically the holocaust repeats itself.</p>
    <p>Other great global deceptions and global <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-evIyrrjTTY&index=143&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw" target="_blank"><b>cataclysms</b></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3O-OEem3XM&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw&index=25" target="_blank"><b>occur</b></a>.</p>
    <p>I'm trying to get you to see how you really need to give your life to Christ. And it would really truly benefit you to give your life to Christ now, rather than later. Because when the moment comes when everything changes, when the false savior rises to world renown, when the vast majority of the world pursues falsehood and a lie, only Jesus Christ will be able to save you from this prison. And the horrors of false gods will be revealed and people will do nothing but indulge in gross sins of every kind, and lies will be called truth, and truth will be called lies, and evil will be called good, and good will be called evil. And evil will be let loose like never before on earth and in the hearts of men and women. But, if you can't believe until these things actually happen (and they will very soon - the beginnings of them are taking place as you and I breathe - the dominoes are almost all lined up), then <i>simply come back to this website and read about how everything that the bible said is going to happen...is happening...and then because you finally have the "proof" you needed, then
      <b>believe in the Lord Jesus Christ</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>What I'm trying to say is this: <i>Jesus Christ is the truth. You either know this or you don't. If you come to know this while living on earth, you can be saved by what He did for you. If you die without faith in Him, there is no hope for your soul, because the blood of Jesus does not cover your sins because of your unbelief, and as an evil sinner, your soul goes to hell. I'm not saying people that know Jesus Christ is truth are good. Far from it. All have sinned and fallen short of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1D2KzfoNB8&index=12&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMawt#t=34m05s" target="_blank"><b>glory of God</b></a>. But God sent His son to save sinners. You can't be mad at God for where you chose to place your soul - He sent His son to save you, He completed His end of the bargain, and selflessly and faithfully and miraculously laid down His very own life for all who believe in Him, <b>but by denying Jesus Christ, you deny your salvation. Jesus is the salvation for the human race. Jesus means salvation. Christ means anointed. Jesus Christ is the anointed salvation for all who believe Him.</b> Come to know Jesus while you still can. And at the
      <b>very</b> least, investigate the history and the truth claims concerning Jesus Christ for yourself <b>as thoroughly as possible</b> before you dismiss Him as God.</p>

    <p>AND IF YOU CAN'T SUMMON THE WILL TO LOOK INTO THE GUY WHO, AT THE VERRRYYYY LEAST (THINK ABOUT THIS) LITERALLY MADE IT WHAT YEAR IT IS TODAY IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD, then I'm urging you, at the very least, when the world gets way weirder than it is now, and darkness creeps into the heart of society like never before, and things you thought weren't possible start happening all over, and you find yourself, for some odd reason, saying to yourself, "Hey, something isn't right here...This isn't <b>really</b> good, but the world is telling me it is...", <b>PLEASE</b>, if for some odd reason this website is still available (though I doubt it because it mentions truth about Jesus Christ), come to this website and remember how the bible foretold the end from the beginning, just as God said He would. AND THEN, LITERALLY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, BELIEVE HIM.</i></p>
    <p>It's all in the bible. Everything that is true is in the bible.</p>
    <p>Be careful though. Be sure you know the Jesus Christ talked about in scripture and throughout the 66 books of the Holy Bible. Be careful, because it would not be past the devil to have his antichrist come bearing the name "Jesus Christ", or something equally as sinisterly deceptive.</p>
    <p>Be sure you know the true Jesus Christ, the one who came, ministered, performed miracles, and died an innocent man, was crucified by people that loathed him for claiming he was God (which is the truth), while people claim they are God every day by disobeying God. The story is poetically brilliant.</p>
    <p>But there is a prideful spirit at work in the world and in the hearts of men and women, and it will stop you from seeing all this as the truth that it is unless you genuinely produce faith in the Lord, repent, and follow Him.

      <p>***</p>
      <p>I'm screamin' at you man.</p>
      <p><i><b>Don't wait until it's too late...</b></i></p>

    <p>Very soon the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords - the true Lord of all creation whose name we know now as Jesus Christ - is going to return for His people.</p>
    <p>This is real. This is happening. Not only is this biblical truth going to manifest in reality in our lifetime, <b>it is going to happen so much sooner than you think</b>. <i>The signs are <b>everywhere</b>.</i></p>
    <p>And you must be lucky or something, because as of this writing, it is within your power to choose the truth and be saved.</p>
    <p>Those with the eyes to see and the ears to hear are seeing and hearing oh so much. The Spirit of the Lord is working beautifully in 2018.</p>
    <p>Much of creation is yearning for the truth to return, expose, and destroy the darkness, as it is written.</p>
    <p>Very soon the Lord will expose the darkness with His glorious light - praise God, for the darkness is devastatingly deep but it cannot overcome His light.</p>
    <p>Very soon the Lord will expose the darkness which has covered the minds of those who put their faith in their own works and false gods and false doctrines.</p>
    <p>We have all been caught in a horrible trap - the world as we know it.</p>
    <p>I cannot stress this enough:</p>
    <p>The world is a trap for each of us since birth, a marvelous snare in the business of trickery and falsehood.</p>
    <p>But behold, THE LORD GOD HAS SET THOSE FREE THAT ARE IN CHRIST.</p>
    <p>Turn to Jesus Christ! The time is quickly approaching when His wrath will be felt across the face of the earth, and many who do not know and believe the truth will be led astray.</p>
    <p>Truly, I tell you, from birth the world has us believing lies like you would not imagine.</p>
    <p>And for a short time, the lies are going to get even greater and more sinister, and the consequences of actions during this short time will be like they are now - eternal.</p>
    <p>HOLD FAST TO THE <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a35tRv6VlAU&index=27&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw" target="_blank"><b>TRUTH</b></a> - HOLD FAST TO JESUS CHRIST - THE JESUS CHRIST OF THE HOLY BIBLE.</p>
    <p>I cannot stress this enough:</p>
    <p>Please, please, please wake up to the vanity that you and me and the whole world is drenched in - a frivolous game toward death.</p>
    <p>Slow down on the wheel that society gives you to run in vain on. Step out of the made-up race for a second, and honestly ask some real questions, the answers to which actually matter:</p>
    <p>..."What on earth are you doing here?...</p>
    <p>...And why are you kept too busy to thoroughly question the nature of your reality?...</p>
    <p>...<i>Why does a society which does not know the answer to why it exists expect you to perform a certain way?</i>...</p>
    <p>...Why do the politicians and "leaders" of every country, and especially the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUEWcH-6x4g&index=69&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw" target="_blank"><b>United States</b></a>, <i>never get anything of lasting significance done</i> and, especially recently <i>promote nothing but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t08h4zlFvm0" target="_blank">divisive</a> issues</i>? Don't you think that if people with legitimate amounts of power and money <b>really</b> wanted to help the world, then they could accomplish more than what they report doing?...</p>
    <p>...Why is there a clear correlation between current political issues and what is on Netflix? Why is there always a correlation between the content of heavily pushed and advertized films and television and politics?</p>
    <p>...You have to ask yourself, once the glass breaks, and your mind sees the patterns all around you: "WHY IS THERE SUCH A CLEAR CONNECTION BETWEEN <b>GOVERNMENT, ENTERTAINMENT,</b> and <b>EDUCATION</b>? WHY DO THOSE THREE FACETS OF LIFE HAVE SO MUCH INFLUENCE ON OUR MIND AND LIVELIHOOD? AND WHY, WHEN YOU STEP OUT OF THE FABRICATED RACE THEY MADE UP FOR US TO RUN, DO YOU SEE HOW THEY ARE ALL ARMS OF THE SAME MALICIOUS MIND, ALL FINGERS OF THE SAME EVIL HAND WHICH DOES ITS BEST TO BLIND ANYONE WHO IS BORN UNDER ITS SHADOW? <b>WHO CONTROLS GOVERNMENT <i>REALLY</i>? WHO CONTROLS ENTERTAINMENT <i>REALLY</i>? WHO CONTROLS "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL9sfppMfw0&index=29&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw" target="_blank"><b>EDUCATION</b></a>" <i>REALLY</i>?</b> And why in God's good name, would the crux of the message of the world be: <i>Conform to us. Follow us. Believe in what we tell you is the truth. Do not question us. We will tell you what to think. All you need to do is follow the law we created, go to the school whose curriculum we fully control, think you have freedom in choosing some career which we also regulate and moderate, and then when you go home - when you are exhausted from a day's labor doing what we have forced you to do in vain, you can turn on the television where we provide the themes and messages of all popular entertainment or go online or on your phone where there is nothing much but distraction and
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paC1ucqZJc8&index=94&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw" target="_blank"><b>vanity</b></a> but we'll invent virtual and invisible likes and upvotes and buttons and games, empty of significance, but we'll get you to love it anyway, and then the highlight of your day can be seeing your children excel in school which little do you know is subtle and sinister indoctrination of so much falsehood and vainglory and knowledge of no value EXCEPT
      <b>in getting you to think that you are the god of your own life and believing the knowledge you learn in the fabricated system is worthy of your time and effort only because it helps you progress further into our system of control, which indeed and truly does blind the whole world to our simultaneous evil devices."</b></i></p>
      <p>...<i>Why does the literature of the occult, the books and writings and teachings of those who literally worship Lucifer as God, who claim Satan as God, who love satanic living and satanic practices and worship Satan in word and in action - why when you read their works do you start to see how what these literal Luciferians want is - as you and I breathe currently - manifesting itself in the reality of the world right now?...</i></p>

    <p>...And why are we all taught not to ask these questions? Or look into these things? Or at least to not spend too much time on them?"...</p>
    <p>I believe because then you would start waking up, so to speak. You would begin to see the hidden chains of slavery the world has its inhabitants in. But someone in control of the world wants you ignorant and asleep. Why is that? Why would some force in the world want you caught up in a lie?</p>
    <p>VERY SOON THERE WILL BE SEEMINGLY UNBELIEVABLE THINGS HAPPENING ACROSS THE FACE OF THE EARTH.</p>
    <p>I cannot stress this enough:</p>
    <p>Do not trust what the world tells you to trust - the world - and at its head, Satan - are out to mislead and destroy your soul.</p>
    <p>Satan is going to come and deceive many and claim he is God. This is a lie and a great evil.</p>
    <p>Be sure your heart is in the right place - with the true Lord of life - Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>The literal devil - yes, he is real; you have bought a lie from the world if you think he is fiction - will claim that all religions are equally viable. He will deceive the world and unite the world into following a one world religion, a one world "spirituality". Many will believe this lie. Many already have been deceived into thinking that truth is not exclusive to one path...But, by definition, truth <b>must</b> be exclusive. By pure reason, sheer logic, by definition, there is one truth. Many lies, but one truth.</p>
    <p>And that one truth is Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>Remember this:</p>
    <p>Satan wants you to not believe in the truth (Jesus Christ) and Satan runs current society - and what does current society do? It diminishes and disregards the authority and truth of Christ and it promotes Satanic, self-serving, self-worshipping, falsehood.</p>
    <p>I know me just saying this is a fact won't make a difference as to whether you believe me or not, but it is still worth saying...the following is a fact:</p>
    <p>The world is tricking you, if you are not in Christ Jesus. The world is trying very hard to get you to not believe in Jesus Christ and what He did for you and how much He loves you.</p>
    <p>Why is this the agenda of the world? Because Satan and the world know that if you believe in Christ, you are saved. But Satan hates you, and so he lies to you, and really tries to control your mind into disregarding Jesus and the validity of the bible.</p>
    <p>THIS IS SERIOUS. I'M NOT KIDDING AROUND. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. IF PEOPLE HAVE MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED RECENTLY, SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY.</p>
    <p>Get busy trusting in Jesus Christ, the anointed salvation for literally <b><i>anyone who believes in Him.</i></b> That's the cutoff. Do you believe Him? Do you trust Him with your life instead of what the world tries to convince you to trust in?</p>
    <p>I am, of course, incredibly biased in this regard, but I do want to explicitly stress how I believe it would be well worth your time to read and digest all of what I have to say on here, but that's not even close to the point. The point of all this is this: MORE THAN ANYTHING - MAKE JESUS CHRIST YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE - FOR YOUR OWN SAKE.</p>
    <p>GET TO KNOW JESUS CHRIST ON A PERSONAL LEVEL. IT IS NOT ABOUT RELIGION...IT IS ABOUT RELATIONSHIP. AND THE ONLY RELATIONSHIP WHICH TRULY MATTERS IS THAT BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER - AND JESUS HAS REVEALED THE TRUTH - THAT JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY TO THE HEAVENLY FATHER, THE TRUE LORD OF ALL CREATION.</p>
    <p>IF YOU KNOW JESUS CHRIST, THEN YOU KNOW THE LORD GOD. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW JESUS CHRIST, THEN YOU DO NOT KNOW THE LORD GOD.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p><b>YOU ARE IN A SYSTEM OF CONTROL. A CLEVERLY DESIGNED SATANIC SYSTEM WHICH DOES ITS BEST TO DISTRACT YOU WITH MEANINGLESS PURSUITS AND VAINGLORY, AND TO DECEIVE YOU INTO LOVING LIES, INTO LOVING ANYTHING BUT THE TRUTH. WE WERE ALL BORN INTO IT. YOU ARE BLIND IF YOU DO NOT SEE IT.</b></p>
    <p>The depth and breadth of the propaganda against Jesus Christ and His truth would astound you. So many lies, it is truly sickening. But, alas, a mountain of lies is the only tool Satan has in his attempt to hide the world from the truth...But you can't hide the truth if the truth wants to reveal itself - and it did through Jesus Christ!</p>
    <p>But the propaganda in this world is real and pervasive. They mock the masses (you and me) right in front of us. They hide in plain sight. Television is their playground. They know how to manipulate the masses (you and me) at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyTI9UFgRpM&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw&index=54" target="_blank"><b>subconscious</b></a> level.</p>
    <p>You begin to see how deep the deception goes when you understand their symbolism and notice the clear-once-revealed agenda. And then the obvious conclusions follow:</p>
    <p>Why would those in charge of what is clearly an evil world have an agenda against this guy which has stuck around named Jesus Christ?</p>
    <p>Why would the heads of literally all world religions be promoting "unity" when the bible clearly foretells that the anti-Christ world system will only promote unity for malicious and tyrannical ends?</p>
    <p>And this one is especially alarming - why would all religions prophesy about a coming spiritual leader who will save the day and usher in the whole world into a new age of love and peace...when the Bible is the only book that warns that the whole world will be deceived by this coming spiritual leader, who will be the antichrist, who is at his heart a false and sinister spiritual savior?</p>
    <p>Why would the people who print our money care so much about dismantling the true church of Jesus Christ, making Christianity seem complex or gnostic or esoteric, inventing divisions and sects of the church - many of which preach false gospels, in addition to continually skewing the public view of "Christians" as more and more hateful?</p>
    <p>And the delusion even extends to this - why is the name of Jesus used and propagated as something to say when you swear, when no other supposed spiritual leader at any point in time is used in such vain? It's subtle, but it is another jab and misdirection from the enemy.</p>
    <p>You already acknowledge <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGaQIa-wiQE" target="_blank"><b>Jesus Christ</b></a> by the year you believe it is. <i>Don't you think it's pretty worthwhile to see what the guy who literally made it what year it is today had to say about reality?</i> All modern calendars are modeled from the impact on the earth that Jesus Christ had. Why?</p>
    <p>Here's why:</p>
    <p>Because Jesus Christ <i>is</i> God.</p>
    <p>Truly, I tell you, there will come a day when this world will literally <i>behead</i> anyone who claims Christ as God.</p>
    <p>That is how much the Master of Lies, Satan, hates the truth. And the Father of Lies hates you, too! He <i>only</i> cares about himself and gaining his own glory, and he wants you to be the same! Satan is imprisoned and blinded by his own hatred of the truth, and so he propagates lies, and if it wasn't for the hand of the Lord God (Jesus Christ) in the way of things, Satan would torture you to death and then spit on your grave. In fact, Satan is doing his best to do that right now, but you probably don't realize it because Satan is operating against you <i>spiritually</i>, not directly-in-your-face obvious. Don't fall for his lies which only seek to mislead people from the truth!</p>
    <p>Come to Jesus before you must suffer such evil. This evil is coming, I promise you. The censorship of free speech that is occurring in America is just the beginning of dark times where eventually Jesus and the truth will be considered "hate speech" or something equally ridiculous.</p>
    <p>Because if your faith is weak in those evil days, and you give into the ways of the world which will surely be enticing, and you deny Jesus Christ at the world's request, it will cost you eternity.</p>
    <p>WHY ARE YOU EVEN INTERESTED IN <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqQtIlWj8Ho&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw&index=8" target="_blank"><b>CONFORMING TO THE WAYS OF THIS WORLD?</b></a></p>

    <p>DON'T YOU THINK OUT OF SEVEN BILLION PLUS PEOPLE, THERE COULD BE SOME SENSIBLE AND EFFICIENT LEADERSHIP ON THIS PLANET?</p>
    <p>BUT THERE IS NOT, BECAUSE <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjFUdyZqeTM&index=49&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw&pbjreload=10" target="_blank"><b>THIS WORLD IS CORRUPT</b></a>, THE MIND BEHIND ALL OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD IS CORRUPT, AND IT WAS CORRUPTED A LONG TIME AGO.</p>
    <p><b>Why would you obey a corrupt system? Why would you listen to what a corrupt system tells you to do?</b></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Here is the God-honest truth:</p>
    <p>If you don't have Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, <i>you are building a sand castle with your life. It doesn't matter how pretty the sand castle looks. A tsunami is coming. And if you do not know Jesus Christ, you are playing in the sand, unaware that the tsunami is quickly approaching the very foundations of your existence. <b>WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING - building a castle out of sand which is already set to be destroyed?</b></i></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Come to Jesus. He has promised a mansion built on everlasting stone, to all who believe in Him. What is stopping you from believing? You have a mansion waiting for you, and an eternal family of amazing people and creations if you could just believe in the truth...</p>
    <p>Because the alternative - hell - is going to be awful. A world without the goodness of God...Truly we cannot imagine the horror to an accurate degree. Don't find out the extent of the horror when it's too late to be saved. Destroy your sand castle <i>now</i>, and get busy on building your life with Christ as the foundation.</p>
    <p>I don't want you to get to the end of your existence, and it all have been for a sand castle which no longer is...</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>There is an amazing, beautiful, powerful God out there, and getting to know Him alone is the most spectacular journey anyone can choose to take. And one of the wonderful things about it, is that it is all about <i><b>your</b> very own personal relationship with the Creator of the heavens and the earth</i>...How amazing is that? That the Lord in His great love pursues us, mere men and women, and wants to engage with us one on one.</p>
    <p>Phillipians 3:7-11 - </p>
    <p><b>"But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</p>
      <p>Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowedge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,</p>
      <p>And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:</p>
      <p>That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;</p>
      <p>If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead."</p></b>

    <p>He is only a genuine prayer away. <i>The Lord of all creation is only a prayer away and so often we find ourselves busy with other things of the world...</i></p>

    <p>You are not exempt from this truth, you simply must make Him and His kingdom a priority, and all else falls into place...</p>
    <p>Proverbs 8:17 - </p>
    <p><b>"I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me."</b></p>
    <p>I, like you, have spent many hours seeking all kinds of things - but where do all the things we seek come from? What is the true source of goodness in experience? What has the power to give life and to take it away? Who sculpted your features? Who brought you into existence?</p>
    <p><b><i>YOU ARE SO VALUABLE TO THE LORD THAT HE LITERALLY DIED FOR YOU. HE WANTS TO BE WITH YOU SO MUCH THAT HE DIED SO IT COULD HAPPEN.</p>
      <p>HE HAS ALREADY ACCEPTED YOU AS YOU ARE. HE WANTS <h1>YOU!</h1>
        <p>HE DOESN'T WANT THE GOOD THINGS YOU HAVE DONE. HE DOESN'T WANT THE BAD THINGS YOU HAVE DONE. HE WANTS YOU.</p>
        <p>DON'T THINK YOUR WORTHY? HE ALREADY SET THE INFINITE PRICE FOR YOU - THE BLOOD OF HIS OWN SON!</p>
        <p>DON'T THINK HE WANTS YOU? HE CAME IN THE FLESH, IN THE LIKENESS OF MEN, LIVED A PERFECT AND SINLESS LIFE AND DIED FOR YOU WHEN NO ONE ASKED HIM TO AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY RIGHT IN NOT DOING SO!</p>
        <p>DON'T THINK HE LOVES YOU? THEN YOU HAVE NOT TAKEN A GOOD LOOK AT THE CROSS AND WHY HE DID WHAT HE DID!</p>
        <p>STILL DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THIS? STILL DON'T WANT TO GET TO KNOW THE LORD? TOO BAD, THE LORD CARES FOR YOU AND THE CROSS AND THE DEATH, BURIAL, AND RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST WILL BE A TESTAMENT THAT HE DOES.</p>
        <p>HE DIED ON THE CROSS SO THAT HE COULD ACCEPT YOU. THE ONLY THING MISSING IS YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF HIM AND WHAT HE DID.</p></b></i>
        <p>That's all that's up to you. Do you honestly believe in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and that what He did for you is enough?</p>
        <p><b>Admit that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior.</b> This means you truly understand that you are a deeply imperfect human being at your core. That there is no amount of good or bad you can do to save you from doing what is not right in this life. That you are a slave to evil thoughts, desires, and actions, and you do not have the power to free yourself from the chains of this evil. You need Jesus Christ, the only Savior for humanity, to save you from a life of evil, and an eternity afterward of what happens to that which is evil.</p>
        <p><b>Believe in your heart Jesus Christ and His true gospel.</b> This means you truly understand that Jesus Christ really is who He says He is. He really did die on the cross for your sins, was buried for three days, and then rose on the third day in accordance with the scriptures. He really is the Son of God, the Word of God, and you know Him as the Lord of your life. Because you believe in the truth of what Jesus has called you to do, you follow Him wherever you go. You trust Him wherever you are. And no matter the circumstance, whether you are feeling the highest of highs or the lowest of lows, you turn to Him because you know all of your life and all of its moments therein He has given to you freely for His good work and purposes.</p>
        <p><b>Call upon His name.</b> Do not forget the Lord your God! Continue to walk with the Lord for the rest of your days, inspired by the truth of His love which is displayed for everyone by the actions of the cross.</p>
        <p><b>Admit</b> you're a sinner, <b>believe</b> in the gospel of Jesus Christ, and <b>call</b> upon His name AND YOU WILL BE SAVED. YOU WILL HAVE A PLACE IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD, SPECIALLY PREPARED BY JESUS HIMSELF. BUT YOU GOTTA BELIEVE. YOU GOTTA HAVE FAITH...</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p><b>I literally cannot stress this enough:</b></p>
      <p>It will be the best thing you ever did. Don't shoot yourself in the foot (more like your own soul, really) and overlook the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPIOkdNL-QQ" target="_blank"><b>truth</b></a> of Jesus Christ...</p>

<h1>
    <u><b><i>Hello World!</i></b></u>
  </h1>

  <!--Opening story-->
    <p>We were in line, as we always were, a bunch of back-breaking bricks on our back.</p>
    <p>But there was a way out, as there always was.</p>
    <p>I peaked in and my heart awoke, and I was glad, really glad for the first time in my life.</p>
    <p>"Look," someone told me. "I have seen the way out of here, and Pharaoh, the prince of the air on the earth, is set on not letting the way in its true form shine everywhere, lest his slaves awake from their slumber, and choose the truth over him. Tomorrow, as you go in line with your fellow slaves, look for me in the brush."</p>
    <p>And so I went back to our barracks and slept restlessly that night. In the morn, according to our master's call, we loaded up the day's bricks on our back and got in line, and began the day's trek, one after the other.</p>
    <p>When we passed the brush, a hand stuck out for me, and I leapt to it, and it pulled me through to the other side. It happened so quickly, I thought we had been subtle. But lo, three of my fellow slaves hurried in after me.</p>
    <p>"What is the matter?" they cried, confused at my behavior.</p>
    <p>I told them the truth:</p>
    <p>"A voice sent a hand</p>
    <p>And the hand offered</p>
    <p>To free me from the line</p>
    <p>Bearing bricks until death."</p>
    <p>And now, on the other side,</p>
    <p>A great chasm opened up, and from the mouth of the chasm I heard the voice.</p>
    <p>It said: "Jump and let my righteousness catch you and transform you."</p>
    <p>"Do you hear it?" I said, my voice dripping with joy, to my fellow slaves. "There is a type of music on this other side, and it is the purest and most wonderful I have ever heard. It is telling us to jump, away from the world we were in previously, the world of Pharaoh and slavery and bricks of no lasting worth, and toward Him and His kingdom."</p>
    <p>"What madness do you speak of?" said the first fellow slave.</p>
    <p>"Jump into <i>that</i>? said the second fellow slave.</p>
    <p>"Fool," said the third. "There is nothing there to catch you when you fall."</p>
    <p>"Far be it from me to choose for my brothers and sisters on the line, but why are you so eager to get back to the line, where Pharaoh has you working for him day and night, all for fading and extraneous creature comforts?"</p>
    <p>"Fool," said the first. "Bricks are the way of the world."</p>
    <p>"Fool," said the second. "What we do on the side we are born into is honorable and good."</p>
    <p>"Fool," said the third. "You may jump into vanity while we will return to matters of worth."</p>
    <p>The voice was fixing to erupt, but I knew not whether it was due to anger or excitement.</p>
    <p>"Do you hear it too? The truest musician, the composer of you and me, He has said that all the bricks that are of Pharaoh, the ruler and prince of this present earth, and of Pharaoh's slaves, all those numb to the symphony surrounding them, the people bound to this earth, will, in the end, crumble into less than nothing. And He will flip everything new when the time is right, and all of our back-breaking brick building will have been in vain. And only those with Him will stand to see the days."</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>"I wish I could say great words that broke through to your heart, fellow slave, words that pierced your soul and awoke you at once, glad like never before.</p>
    <p>"But all I have are the words on this page and the words before you now:</p>
    <p><i>It is in Pharaoh's best interest to diminish the true Savior.</i></p>
    <p><i>It is in Pharaoh's best interest to convince you that Egypt is all there is, that there isn't a promised land for you to dwell, actually free from Pharaoh's spells.</i></p>
    <p><i>It is in Pharaoh's best interest to convince you that the power of Christ is null and the character of Christ is questionable.</i></p>
    <p><i>It is in Pharaoh's best interest to make you love Egypt and its comforts, make you addicted to them, so much so that you are content to carry on for the rest of your life, saying in your heart, "Look at all of us intelligent and capable Egyptians, building bricks to the sky for ourselves and for our master. Surely Egypt is all there is! Surely we are meant to be and act as Egyptians! Surely we are right in doing our best as Egyptians! The way of the world is the way of the brick, and the way of a person in the world is to bear the brick, accumulate bricks, and build a grand old tower of personally significant bricks, all to the glory of a lost moment in the blink of an eye."</i></p>
    <p>But something was missing, and my fellow slaves could not believe a word I had said.</p>
    <p>"You're crazy," said the first.</p>
    <p>"You're lost," said the second.</p>
    <p>"Fool," said the third. "My bricks are mighty and my tower is high, my spirit is wise and it is I who am right. Behold, I will have great honor among our fellow slaves at the end of my life when the whole world will perceive all of my greatness, surely in the form of bricks borne here in Egypt."</p>
    <p>I winced in pain for the chasm between us was steep and gloomy, deep and long.</p>
    <p>My fellow slaves ran back through the brush to the other side, but before the brush closed, I heard Pharaoh yelling from the top of his throne so all the land could hear -</p>
    <p>"I have heard, my slaves, there are rumors going around that you are not bound to bearing bricks and serving me, rumors that there is a better way of life for those in the land of Egypt. I'd like to inform you of some cold hard facts, and I assure you these are scientifically proven, so the rational side of you may rest easy in this truth:</p>
    <p>"One, there are so many rumors of so many different ways out of Egypt. Do you actually think that one of them is true? This is absurd. Either all are true or all are false, or at least some are true and the rest are false, but do you actually think that one way could be the only way out of the land? You must be a lunatic to believe otherwise.</p>
    <p>"Two, I have been generous in my giving to you in the land of Egypt - you have had bread to eat, a place to rest your head, and <i>I have provided much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEiZ0j1Jx2M&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw&index=41" target="_blank"><b>circus</b></a> for your attention, much entertainment surely not to distract you, much fabrication and falsehood surely not to lead you down my path of destruction - I promise you, if only you stay in line, and enjoy the bread and circuses I have set conveniently before you, you will be so busy with my distractions that you will be happy!</i> Do you actually think that there is a better place than the land before you now? Do you actually think that there is more to life than what you can see and touch and feel? This is absurd. You must be a fool to believe otherwise.</p>
    <p>"And lastly, remember, just as you learned in school, I promise you - it is a good thing to bear bricks, for I promise you, I use them for a good purpose. The more you believe that it is good to slave away for bricks, and to build cute little pyramids of accomplishment and experience for yourself, and the more you stay in line with the others who also have their own dreamed up brick quotas to build and bear, I promise you, the happier you will be in the long run. This is Pharaoh's promise."</p>
    <p>And I was astonished, on the other side of the brush, because the crowd of Egyptians erupted in applause.</p>
    <p>But because I had put faith in the hand that brought me to the other side, and because I chose to listen to the voice of the Law, I recoiled in disgust at the noise I heard from the Egyptian side of life. How ever had I listened to Pharaoh's promises before? I must've been under some odd spell, because Pharaoh's voice had turned into the most repulsive sound imaginable. And I cried and lamented much in that hour, for Pharaoh was given power over his slaves, and he wielded it selfishly, yet they thought what they did was good for themselves, but, behold, every letter in every language Pharaoh took advantage of to spread conniving and sadistic and <i>hidden-like-you-wouldn't-believe</i> lies.</p>
    <p>I jumped. Past the abyss, I fell into a meadow, light in every direction.</p>
    <p>"Now," I heard the voice say, so much music in one syllable.</p>
    <p>And in the distance I saw the great and grand pyramids of Egypt, where every brick of every one of Pharaoh's people was brought together and piled high, a magnificent feat in the sight of men. And I saw billions of tiny pyramids too.</p>
    <p>And no sooner did I hear now then a foot descended from heaven and crushed and crumbled all that was in the land of Egypt.</p>
    <p>Awestruck, I realized my legs had been pushing daisies in the meadow I had fallen into. As I stood up, I began to rub my eyes - I was tired, and I didn't know exactly where I was, but I knew there was a lot of light around! And as I was rubbing my eyes, "How You Been?" by Harrison Fjord began playing from precisely the 1:35 mark, just before the guitar absolutely shreds.</p>
    <p>I opened my eyes, witnessed the great expanse of light which touched all that I could see, and said to myself, and no one heard,</p>
    <p>"Oh my, oh my,</p>
    <p>There was so much strife and it was all a lie,</p>
    <p>Striving to win at a game where you die,</p>
    <p>Souls breaking and hearts crying,</p>
    <p>Children lost and people pining,</p>
    <p>Always working and always trying</p>
    <p>Never resting and never finding,</p>
    <p>The harmony in the discord</p>
    <p>The Word of God</p>
    <p>true and powerful</p>
    <p>living and active</p>
    <p>sharper than any double-edged sword</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Oh damn oh damn</p>
    <p>you would not believe</p>
    <p>what I got in my thoughts</p>
    <p>is like the spear of a dream</p>
    <p>piercing all of</p>
    <p>these words flow like water</p>
    <p>down the stream of truth</p>
    <p>not a single gleam unfettered</p>
    <p>no love unsheltered</p>
    <p>no no no son</p>
    <p>you have no idea what is comin'</p>
    <p>the love that I'm about to spurt from my lips to the tips of my failing phalanges</p>
    <p>oh you haven't got a clue what I've been brewin' down deep in my soul of souls</p>
    <p>it's about to blow</p>
    <p>oh no no no</p>
    <p>I gotta say</p>
    <p>it's a beautiful day</p>
    <p>and this is how it's gonna stay that way:</p>
    <p>Once upon a time there was the most misunderstood man you could ever imagine</p>
    <p>and he knew not himself</p>
    <p>but he had a hunch over lunch</p>
    <p>that the strife of life pointed to the anointed by God with a bod</p>
    <p>no sod</p>
    <p>just succulent nutrients of the sweetest honey</p>
    <p>so homey was his heart that he wandered the ends of the earth</p>
    <p>proclaiming not shaming the truth in us all which is hailed from heaven</p>
    <p>and behold he only had five loaves of bread and two fish in his pockets</p>
    <p>but a sinister sick voice said take the pocket pretty</p>
    <p>but the misheard heathen listened not</p>
    <p>and quickly fastened his ears to the hum of his own heart</p>
    <p>and the rhythm spelled out a questionable question</p>
    <p>that's quest was to identify truth</p>
    <p>for no soul on earth had filled the shoes that truth demanded</p>
    <p>but behold:</p>
    <p>surfing on the waves of heaven and crashing onto earth in a manger the chosen one was born</p>
    <p>and here we are discussing the only person who ever knew</p>
    <p>who ever got it - that elusive it that we're all chasing and wanting and is the literal epitome of desire</p>
    <p>He has it</p>
    <p>that sinless beast of a man</p>
    <p>holy and righteous is his walk</p>
    <p>and timeless and wholesome is his victory on the cross</p>
    <p>and what is the cross but the symbol of the act that is the literal epitome of love</p>
    <p>and I am here writing this now to tell you what your very soul craves:</p>
    <p>the love and relationship that is only shown and provided by Jesus Christ</p>
    <p>for behold,</p>
    <p>that questionable question was "what is truth"</p>
    <p>and it is an ill-fated inquiry of humanity for we had it wrong from the first word</p>
    <p>for the true question of love is "who is truth"</p>
    <p>and all is null that doesn't benefit the ordained endeavor of the answer to that question</p>
    <p>who is Christ Jesus</p>
    <p>who walked and talked and ate with sinners</p>
    <p>to save those that listened and believed from their sins</p>
    <p>and to serve those</p>
    <p>and to give them His own reward</p>
    <p>which is eternal life with the Father of creation</p>
    <p>and behold,</p>
    <p>that makes me your brother in humanity</p>
    <p>whoever you are reading this</p>
    <p>and so,</p>
    <p>from a brother to another</p>
    <p>heed my message and my message is this:</p>
    <br />
    <p>I LOVE YOU.</p>
    <br />
    <p>But you are loved so much more by the God who gave His only son so that you may be with Him.</p>

        <p>It has taken far too long, but I now finally realize the following - people want to hear certain things from certain people. I know - shocking, right? <i>People want to hear what they want to hear</i>. And anything that is opposed to that makes them grumble. So rather than always deal with the griping of in-person conversation concerning such seemingly controversial topics such as God and life and death, I've decided to create this website. For the beauty in this is that you read what I write if you want to or are curious about what I've said and for no other reason. No one is forcing you to read thus far, and that's a wonderful and beautiful thing. If you want to go and do something else and forget about everything I've said on here, you totally can, and you totally should if that's how you genuinely feel.</p>
        <p>But if there's a part of you that is curious about questioning the nature of things around you, I urge you to read on, with the upmost yearning for joy and for life and for this moment, because I promise you - there is a level of connection out there that is so beautiful I want everyone to have it even if it kills me.</p>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQZw9Ca4tX0" target="_blank">Beauty</a>

        <p>There is so much beauty in the world. If you blink, you'll miss it.</p>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbJP-_Oasks" target="_blank">Yep.</a>
        <p>I’ll say it before, and I’ll say it again. Life moves pretty fast. You don’t stop and look around once and awhile, you could miss it.</p>
        <p>You don’t stop and give a real good look at the brevity of existence, the vanity of human pursuit, and yet the simultaneous and inescapable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00Q0YmCRa1Y&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw&index=124" target="_blank"><b>beauty</b></a> of life – you <i>will</i> miss it.</p>
        <p>It's like my whole life I have been stumbling, fumbling to articulate these words which are before you now.</p>
        <p>This is as delicately as I can put it.</p>
        <p>I've done quite a bit of thinking and as of now I have quite a bit to say…</p>
        <p>Long has my soul been wanting to communicate this message to anyone and everyone, and now that I have the time, the perspective, the words, and the will, I finally may do so.</p>
        <p>What I have sought out of life is how to live it in full.</p>
        <p>My credentials are my credentials. You will either like what I have to say or you will not. So do not let any externalities influence your judgment on my message. Judge the message. And if you find the message to be sound and of good nature, then you know you can trust the messenger.</p>
        <p>I have sought to ponder the complexities of the universe and likewise the human spirit and I have loved every firing of every neuron.</p>
        <p>Let me level with you, like a man.</p>
        <p>I was sent here to tell you the most wonderful news - and I fear that if you blink, you may miss it.</p>

          <p class="phosphate">"I'd tell you all you want and more, if the sounds I made could be what you hear."</p>
          <p> - David Foster Wallace, <i>Infinite Jest</i></p>

          <p>If you are searching for a sign, this is it.</p>
          <p>If you are reading this, it's not too late.</p>
          <br />
          <p class="phosphate">"We have, each of us, a life-story, an inner narrative - whose continuity, whose sense, is our lives. It might be said that each of us constructs and lives, a 'narrative', and that this narrative is us, our identities. If we wish to know about a man, we ask 'what is his story - his real, inmost story?' - for each of us is a biography, a story. Each of us is a singular narrative, which is constructed, continually, unconsciously, by, through, and in us - through our perceptions, our feelings, our thoughts, our actions; and, not least, our discourse, our spoken narrations. Biologically, physiologically, we are not so different from each other; historically, as narratives - we are each of us unique. To be ourselves we must have ourselves - possess, if need be re-possess, our life stories. We must 'recollect' ourselves, recollect the inner drama, the narrative, of ourselves. A man needs such a narrative, a continuous inner narrative, to maintain his identity, his self."
          </p>
          <p> - Oliver Sacks, <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat</i></p>
          <br />
          <p>Life is precious.</p>
          <p>Life is all about relationships. It is about the moments you share with the people beside you.</p>
          <p>In order to have a relationship, you must sacrifice something – whether it be time, opportunity, or your very own life. A relationship, at the very least, is made up of two distinct entities that choose to engage with each other because it is mutually beneficial to do so.</p>
          <p>Ask anyone that has been in the trenches of a relationship and they will tell you what a successful relationship really all boils down to – communication.</p>
        <p><u>What is communication?</u></p>
          <p>Communication is the absolute most important component to a thriving and mutually beneficial relationship. Why is this true? Because communication breeds understanding and genuine understanding within a relationship leads to a significant and better experience for everyone involved. Communication reinforces the bonds within a relationship, which is necessary to sustain it.</p>
          <p>To communicate is to pass on information.</p>
          <p>To make matters simpler, let us call one entity in a relationship the giver, when they are the ones giving information and let us call the other entity in the relationship the receiver, when they are the ones receiving the information.</p>
          <p>So, in a relationship where communication occurs, the giver passes on information to the receiver. This then increases the knowledge of the receiver of the information, ideally leading to a wiser and better suited response from the receiver, all to the benefits of all parties involved.</p>
        <p><u>Why do we communicate?</u></p>
          <p>In a functioning relationship, both sides communicate with each other. One side gives a message which the other side receives. Then, the roles are reversed, and the one who received now gives, and the one who gave now receives. On and on and on, all to the benefit of both sides in a healthy and righteous relationship. This is how a relationship works.</p>
          <p>This is the gift of life - to be able to engage in relationships and interactions and encounters with one another, to be able to share great moments of all kinds.</p>
          <p>And that’s the funny thing about this world that we currently share – if you are human and you have the breath of life in you, you crave a certain kind of connection with whoever is around you. You crave to be known by others and to know others. You crave to be loved by others and to love others. You crave to be wanted by others and to want others. You crave to experience others and have others experience you.</p>
          <p>And that is why we communicate – to be known and to know, to be loved and to love, to be wanted and to want, and to be experienced and to experience.</p>
          <p>And that too is what we desire out of life – to be known and to know, to be loved and to love, to be wanted and to want, and to be experienced and to experience. To give and receive.</p>
          <p>It is put more eloquently in <i>Children of the Mind</i> by Orson Scott Card: "No, she doesn't want that. Not in her deepest heart. She wants what everyone wants - to be loved and cared for, to be part of something beautiful and fine, to have the respect of those she admires."</p>
          <p>I firmly believe, on some level, all individuals want the above. Even those that would swear otherwise. We all want to have good experiences, and if we cannot find the love that our soul craves, or be part of something that is beautiful and fine, or garner the respect from esteemed individuals, then we search for those feelings elsewhere, often times at the expense of overtly vain and selfish pursuits.</p>
          <p>Here is what I want to reiterate at this point:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Life is about relationships.</li>
              <li>Communication is what makes or breaks a relationship.</li>
            </ol>
          <p>We all experience life (and relationships in life (and communication within relationships in life)) <i>hoping for what is really the same thing</i> - some<i>thing</i> (or perhaps, some<i>one</i>) that provides the love that we truly crave, the wisdom that we truly desire, and the relationship fulfillment which we all yearn for.</p>
          <p>In fact, some<i>thing</i> cannot provide the love we truly crave, because it takes a person (or some intelligent identity) to actually, verbally, actively <i>love</i>.</p>
          <p>Some<i>thing</i> cannot provide the wisdom that we truly desire, because in order to imitate true wisdom, there needs to be a personal example in one's life. You need to see and know a wise <i>person</i> to properly understand wisdom.</p>
          <p>Some<i>thing</i> cannot fulfill us from a relational standpoint, because there is no real relationship between an individual and some<i>thing</i>. The individual may give information and the individual may receive information - but the object, the thing - no matter how much it imitates identity - cannot genuinely give information and receive information - at least not to the extent another human being may.</p>
          <p>No, life is about genuine and authentic relationships between people. No screen, no virtual reality, no artificial intelligence, no inauthentic experience of reality will satiate our palate for fulfilling relationships, but face-to-face honest communication between individuals. Life is about meeting amazing people and cultivating authentic and wonderful relationships with the people around you. But that’s not it, either. This paragraph is close to what it’s all about, but it is not it entirely.</p>
          <p>Life is about <i>the</i> someone. Life is about the someone that can and will provide the love we truly crave, the wisdom we truly desire, and the relationship fulfillment we all yearn for. Because if you know what it means to be human, then you know, to your core, no doubt, that to be human is to love imperfectly, to frolic in folly and hypocrisy and sin, and to demand a certain selflessness in others that you fail to provide yourself. So, in this world, it is not enough to know and be known, to love and be loved, to want and be wanted, to experience and be experienced by the imperfection of others because we are designed to be fulfilled by the perfection of the ultimate epitome of relationship – the relationship between oneself and the Lord God Almighty.</p>
          <p>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
          <p>First things first.</p>
          <p>So there is life. And life is a series of relationships. And the quality of relationships are increased through communication.</p>
        <p><u>And so to what end do we all go through life communicating often with many people?</u></p>
          <p>Bearing in mind that we all want basically the same thing – to know and to be known, to love and to be loved, to want and to be wanted, and to experience and be experienced – why is there so much corruption, hatred, murder, slander, gossip, misunderstanding, brokenness, fraud, illness, depression, jealousy and pure sheer evil in this world of ours?</p>
          <p>By and large, people have goodness in their heart and people will do good things if called upon, if they understand it is worthwhile to do the good thing. But here's an issue in this world of man: no one asks, no one reaches out, no one takes just and righteous advantage of their peers and the world around them. <i>Something halts us from great communication and the ability to follow through on trusting others.</i></p>
          <p>And that something is fear. Because communicating intimately with someone requires a certain vulnerability that we all are typically only comfortable sharing with a husband or a wife, and tragically, often times not even then.</p>
          <p>But what if it was possible to not let that fear build up walls your ego guards day and night? What if it was possible to let love tear down those walls that, while deceptively claiming to be keeping you safe from the outside world, are in reality keeping the outside world from seeing your honest self who is truly brilliant, especially when understood completely?</p>
          <p>But that's a question for those born again, those who produce <b><i><u>LIFE</u></i></b> by the power of the <b><i><u>ULTIMATE LIFE-GIVER</u></i></b>.</p>
          <p>And we are all born busy in death. But the beautiful thing is – we get to decide. We have the power to choose. Death or life. Ourselves or others. Selfishness or selflessness. Hate of rivals or love for enemies. Stubbornness or forgiveness. Wrong or right. Evil or good.</p>
          <p>And as I grow older and older and eventually die here on this putrid earth which rots in sin, I can feel my sense of hearing dying too. And that depresses me greatly, because music is a wonderful thing. But, though the cacophony and confusion of reality produces a lot of noise in the ears of a person inclined to hear, it all remains gorgeously melodious music <i>because I know the someone who can and will and did and does provide the richest love in all of existence, the someone who genuinely wants to engage in authentic relationship with every single human being, the someone who not only wants to know and be known, to love and be loved, to want and be wanted, to experience and be experienced - but is the catalyst and overseer and LORD of every relationship ever.</i> AND BECAUSE OF HIM - BECAUSE OF THE LORD GOD - BEAUTY ABOUNDS, LOVE SPREADS, GRACE SURVIVES, PEOPLE LIVE, AND THE WHEEL OF HISTORY CONTINUES TO ROLL DOWN HIS PATH OF MYSTERIOUS GLORY.</p>
          <p>And so, I now reveal to you what this website is.</p>
          <p>This is a call to those who are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8NVLq2fGLc&index=74&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw" target="_blank"><i>alive</i></a>. The phone is ringing, my friend. Pick up! There's someone at the door. Go open it!</p>
          <p>And to those who are dead or dying - this is my serenade, my song, my heart-throbbing, gut-wrenching, last-ditch cry for you to die to deathly and lawless ways, to see self-seeking for the chaotic vanity that it is, and ultimately to be disciplined in righteousness and repentance through an undying trust in the righteousness of the Lord God.</p>
          <p>And repentance is nothing more than <i>choosing to turn away from worshipping and loving sin to, instead, like you are designed, so as to maximize the joy and love of who you are, and for the sake of your well-being, to focus all of your heart and mind and soul on loving and knowing and wanting and experiencing the Lord God, whose character and being can be found in the personhood of Jesus Christ, who lived a perfect life and then died on a cross, crucified by His people who misunderstood Him and His Word, and then three days later was resurrected from the grave, and is now seated at the right hand of Our Heavenly Father, who rules heaven and earth and has power over all, who loves His people so dearly and with such compassion that He gave His only son so that they may be with Him despite their sinful self-absorption.</i></p>

        <h2><u>PART 2 - INTRODUCTION</u></h2>
          <p>Life is characterized by movement of its own accord.</p>
          <br />
          <p>This means to be <i>alive</i></p>
          <br />
          <p>one must be in motion,</p>
          <br />
          <p>one must be changing.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Life is characterized by this ability to change.</p>
          <br />
          <p>This means</p>
          <br />
          <p>if you are stagnant in your growth,</p>
          <br />
          <p>if you are incapable of changing,</p>
          <br />
          <p>you are as good as dead.</p>
          <br />
          <p>So to live righteously is to recognize the good and evil within you, to die to that evil and to strive for the good, and <i>change</i>. And then love others with the veracity of Jesus Christ.</p>

                <p>Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</p>
                <p>Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;</p>
                <p>Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</p>

                <p>He will not always chide: neither will he keep <i>his anger</i> for ever.</p>
                <p>He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</p>
                <p>For as the heaven is high above the earth, <i>so</i> great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</p>
                <p>As far as the east is from the west, <i>so</i> far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</p>
                <p>Like as a father pitieth <i>his</i> children, <i>so</i> the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</p>
                <p>For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we <i>are</i> dust.</p>
                <p>As <i>for</i> man, his days <i>are</i> as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</p>

                <p>But the mercy of the Lord <i>is</i> from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;</p>
                <p>To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</p>

            <p><u>John 5:24-47</u></p>
            <div class="redletters">
            <p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that hearteh my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into dondemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</p>
            <p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</p>
            <p>For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</p>
            <p>And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</p>
            <p>Marven not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</p>
            <p>And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</p>
            <p>I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</p>
            <p>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</p>
            <p>There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness whcih he witnesseth of me is true.</p>
            <p>Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</p>
            <p>But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</p>
            <p>He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</p>
            <p>But I have greater witness than <i>that</i> of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</p>
            <p>And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</p>
            <p>And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</p>
            <p>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</p>
            <p>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</p>
            <p>I receive not honour from men.</p>
            <p>But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</p>
            <p>I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</p>
            <p>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that <i>cometh</i> from God only?</p>
            <p>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is <i>one</i> that accuseth you, <i>even</i> Moses, in whom ye trust.</p>
            <p>For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</p>
            <p>But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</p>

          <p>A good chunk of the first part of this website will be explaining what I’m trying to get at with all these words. There are many things that I want you to understand through this message.</p>

            <li>Why is there so much disconnection between people in the world?</li>
            <li>What ought I to fear and what ought I to love?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>My whole life I have yearned to stretch my eyes open to this underlying beauty which pervades our reality that can only be described as “the divine”. I have found it is not of one's own will that their eyes are opened to this all-encompassing beauty, but the sole doing of Our Heavenly Father. And per His will, I have found that we and likewise our surroundings are absolutely drenched in it.</p>
          <p>I refuse to live a life where I am not fully present. It has taken longer than I would have liked, but I have learned and am still learning how to be in love with the present moment. My fear is that many, like myself in the past, and no doubt on occasion in my future, will miss the moment. This is terrifying upon reflection, because when all is said and done, and we are able to look past our anxieties and fears concerning our troublesome past or our unknown future, the present moment is the only thing we really have.</p>
          <p>From the poem of creation to the weirdness of the universe on both a large and small scale, to dimensions and understanding, to the combination and clashing of the physical self versus the spiritual self within the human being, I have long been left speechless before the beauty surrounding me.</p>
          <p>But now I have something to say. And I'll be saying it until the day I die.</p>
          <p><b><i><u>THERE. IS. MORE.</u></i></b></p>
          <p>To you. To life. To your role in life. To everything. There is so much going on here, on this earth.</p>
          <p>I am so utterly convinced of it that I have dropped out of college and gone overseas to give my whole self over to the discovery and exploration of experiencing the hidden but deep beauty of life.</p>
          <p>I had to leave conventional education because, in school – at least in my own circumstances, I was quickly learning to distract myself with the mundane as well as from honestly comprehending the majesty of existence and the beauty of sacred personalities around me. (And that, my friends, is all that matters. Forget that and you are a dead man walking.) I was overly busy with what I realized were ultimately meaningless pursuits, because eventually I understood that all of the many hoops people jump through to perform a certain way in school are - unless it truly is your absolute dream to have a certain occupation that requires particular schooling - in order to make more money...and money, while necessary, is, unless properly tamed, an extremely evil idol to the soul. Likewise, the deceptive culture of prosperity, materialism, and, more than anything - hedonism, which has all been carefully and sinisterly cultivated in American society has succeeded in the hearts and minds of many to, unbeknownst to them that covet that life, their detriment. Additionally, especially knowing what I know now concerning the truth and Jesus Christ, when you step back and see how universities (except for a select few) are blatantly biased against anything that isn't in line with the liberal agenda (whose advocates are desperate to try to create and promote their own righteousness outside of the only place where righteousness comes from - that given by the Judeo-Christian God), how there are literally MAJORS now called "Gender Studies" and "Evolutionary Biology", how way too much money is charged for information that could be found elsewhere for free (admittedly though, people go to college for the experience and resources and resume-building, not so much for learning the actual information), you see how college is another deep breeding ground for indoctrination into accepting the tenets, lifestyle, and operation of the new world order, and at the very least numbs people to the evil within the world, teaching all sorts of falsehood because it neglects the reason for life (because people can't accept the true reason - Jesus Christ - because we love to be the god of our own lives, thinking we are the god of our future, and the god of what is good for people to do...but our life only becomes genuinely alive when we make Jesus Christ the righteous God of it, for He knows the future, and He alone knows what is truly good for people to do). I also began to understand how it is especially fruitless to find pride and self-esteem in any secular work - except insofar as your job allows you to connect others to Jesus - because the end result of
            <b>all</b> human achievement on this present earth is going to be the evil new world order that the Bible exposes. And then you realize people's eternity, people's soul, is what is truly at stake here, and one's bank account and silly piece of paper listing worldly accomplishments in order to persuade others to increase one's bank account suddenly becomes a cruel joke compared to the value of another human being...
          </p>
          <p>I will refuse to let the world kill me and my spirit.</p>
          <p>And so here is what the Lord did to me to get me to be where I am now.</p>
          <div id="collegeepiphany" class="angsananew">
            <p>The Lord gave me a taste of a fraction of true naked vanity - the state of our heart when we are not in tune with His composition. And what I perceived was horrifying.</p>
          </div>
          <p>I created this website in order to better illustrate to any who are curious enough what I know to be true to the core of my soul – one of many things being that life is meant to be lived in full, our potential is meant to be met, love is meant to be cherished, and above all, our relationships with others are to be adored and cultivated with care.</p>
          <p>I hope that after watching the above link, in addition to recognizing the bewildering environment surrounding you at the present moment, you may agree you and I live in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at_f98qOGY0&index=130&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw" target="_blank"><b>awesome and captivating reality</b></a>.</p>
          <p>I have fallen in love – with the awesomeness, that is. And for a long time, I thought it was the awesomeness of this world – despite it being the chaotic mess that it is.</p>
          <p>But now it is clear that all of the awesomeness has one powerful source - and He has a name, and a throne, and a soul, and He is carefully cultivating the most amazing kingdom that ever will be.</p>
          <p>And right now the invitation is out, and the letter to everyone is the Bible, the Holy Book of God that the world spits on because it calls out the world for what it is - evil and lost.</p>
          <p>I know I have reiterated my intentions again and again, but I must be as clear as possible with matters like these. What I’m aiming to accomplish through all of what I’m telling you is to properly and fully explain to you why we should be in consistent awe of life, people, and our potential, because of how great the King of kings is. Now that I have the time to collect my thoughts and the will to spill my soul, I am going to explain to the best of my ability why our duty is to love the truth through our actions and our hearts – and this especially means <i>not</i> doing whatever is right in our own eyes. I am going to explain how we should have no fear of all earthly endeavors that seek to plague our minds with dread, <i>especially</i> when we know that heaven is knocking at our door. And, ultimately, I’m going to answer the question that has plagued my mind my entire life:</p>

          <h2><u>PART 3 - BREAKFAST</u></h2>
          <p>First, let us paint a picture of what life is. Go take it easy and watch <i>Pulp Fiction</i> by Quentin Tarantino in full and get back to me. This section will only make complete sense if you have seen the movie recently.</p>
          <p>Though a film is a falsely created reality, a series of deliberate illusions, and though the actual narrative of <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is entirely fictional, I believe that <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is packed with so many aspects of reality that it deserves to be understood in full. Now, this film is so amazing because it resonates with reality in a variety of ways that, upon further inquiry, accurately correlate with the world as we know it. I am going to illustrate what these different aspects are and use <i>Pulp Fiction</i> as a platform to define what life is.</p>
          <p>If this website is anything, it is the equivalent of Jules Winnfield sitting down with Vincent Vega for breakfast as they discuss the happenings of their world. Both men experienced something. Both men experienced life that morning. One is unaffected by the coincidences around him and the other is deeply moved by the miracles around him. One dismisses life as chance and a series of random movements, indecipherable coincidence. And the other is confident that something higher and greater than themselves is involved, in control, and orchestrating something greater than what we can imagine. I’m here to tell you, go, look around you, go outside to the highest hill in your neighborhood, gaze up into the sky, feel the silent buzz of the atmosphere enveloping you, be keenly aware of the intricacies of your heart and the complexity of your mind and listen as carefully as you can to the words of Mr. Winnfield: “This was divine intervention.”</p>
          <p>And odds are you do not have the effort to continue reading - that is, assuming you have punished your time and eyes thus far at all. Or, you do not believe reading what I have to say would be worthwhile. And that is a fine and reasonable conclusion. By all means, return to what you would rather do or what you need to be doing. But, please, for your sake, question the reality around you and truly seek to know if there is indeed more to life than what meets the eye. And if this is where our time together stops, I have to leave you with the only proper response I can think of, courtesy of Jules Winnfield himself: “Don’t do that. Don’t fuckin’ blow this shit off. What happened here was a fuckin’ miracle. This shit doesn’t just happen. We should be fuckin’ dead, my friend. What happened here was a miracle and I want you to fucking acknowledge it.”</p>
          <p>***</p>
          <p>Right now, I’m Jules, and you and I, we’re out to breakfast. It’s early, and we have a full day ahead of us. The sun is beaming down hot, sweet, succulent sunshine and the diner we’re at is alive with chatter, busy brains, and meandering minds. I am going to let the conversation between the gangster and soon to be ex-gangster ensue as a prelude to what I must tell you concerning <i>Pulp Fiction</i> and life as we know it.</p>
          <div class="courier">
            <p>Vincent Vega: “Oh man, that’s good. That’s good, man. You’re, like, starting to lighten up. You’ve been sittin’ there, all serious and shit.”</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Man, I’ve just been sittin’ here thinkin’.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "About what?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "About the miracle we witnessed."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "The miracle <i>you</i> witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "What is a miracle, Vincent?"</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "An act of God."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "And what's an act of God?"</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "When, um, God makes the impossible possible. But, this morning I don't think qualifies."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Hey Vincent, don’t you see, that shit don’t matter. Your judgin’ this shit the wrong way. I mean it could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke to Pepsi, he found my fuckin’ car keys. You don’t judge shit like this based on merit. Now whether or not what we experienced was an according to Hoyle miracle is insignificant. But what is significant, is I felt the touch of God. God got involved.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "But why?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Well, that’s what’s fuckin’ with me, I don’t know why. But I can’t go back to sleep.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "You serious? You really thinkin' about quittin'?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "The life?"</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Yeah."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "Most definitely."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Fuck. Whatcha gonna do then?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Well, that’s what I’ve been sitting here, contemplating. First, I’m going to deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I’m just going to walk the Earth.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Whatchu mean, "walk the earth"?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “You know, like Caine in Kung Fu. Walk from place to place…meet people…get in adventures.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "And how long do you intend to walk the earth?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "Until God puts me where He wants me to be."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "And what if He don't do that?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "Well, if it takes forever, then I'll walk forever."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "So you decided to be a bum?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "I'll just be Jules, Vincent. No more, no less."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: “No, Jules, you decided to be a bum. Just like all those pieces of shit out there that beg for change, who sleep in garbage bins, who eat what I throw away. They got a name for that, Jules. It’s called a <i>bum</i>. And without a job, a residence, or legal tender, that’s what you’re gonna be man – a fuckin’ <i>bum</i>.”</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Jules, look, what happened this morning, man, I agree, it was peculiar, but water into wine, I -"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "All shapes and sizes, Vincent."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "If my answers frighten you, Vincent, then you should cease asking scary questions."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: “I’m gonna take a shit…Let me ask you somethin’. When did you make this decision, when you were sittin’ there eatin’ that muffin’?”</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Well yeah. I was sittin’ here eatin’ my muffin and drinkin’ my coffee, replayin’ the incident in my head, when I had, what alcoholics refer to as “a moment of clarity”.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Fuck. To be continued."</p>
          </div>
          <p>This is the situation that I am presented with. I am like Jules in that I have felt the touch of God. God got involved. And the world is like Vincent in that it does not understand Jules and it absolutely does not know nor understand the God that has been involved in Jules’ whole life.</p>
          <p>This is a God who is involved in all of our lives, whether we know it or not. This is a God of love, a God that seeks a relationship with you, yes, YOU READING THIS. The Great Creator, the Righteous Judge, the Sovereign King, the Ruling-Center-of-All-That-Is, the Great-I-Am loves you more than you can imagine. The problem is, in order for love in a relationship to be realized, both parties have to want to engage with each other. And so God will never force you to do anything with Him. He will let you do as you see fit, if you so wish. (How amazing is that? The freedom He gives us...) But doing as you see fit outside of a relationship with God will only lead to despair in the long run (whether in this life or the next), because all that is good comes from the Lord - every gift of every kind. But I am, and many others are, here to tell you that a relationship with God is what is lacking in all of us. And God has revealed himself through his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
          <p>I began seeking God not too long ago and now that I see sin for what it is, and truth for what it is, I see God was and is and will be with me always. And I haven’t uncovered anywhere close to half of all the wonder and joy and glory of life, but I know that I am onto something that is absolutely and amazingly good. And I know that the love that I am near to is what we <i>all</i> long for at the core of our being – the love and relationship and fulfillment provided by Jesus Christ. Many hate Jesus Christ and therefore love death (because Jesus Christ is who brings forth life...), but I know that if everyone could see Jesus for who he is, and come to know Him for who he is, they would realize that He is what they have been seeking in everything. He is the solution to all of our problems. He is the answer to all of our questions. He is the author of all the brilliance that you are blessed to know.</p>
          <p>Hear me out on all that I have to say and I believe it will have been well worth your time.</p>
          <p>Back to what life is.</p>
          <p>Here is the argument I am making. <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is like life and life is like <i>Pulp Fiction</i>. Here's why.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Life is a <i>story</i>, just like how <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is a story.
            <p>A story is a narrative designed to interest, amuse, or instruct the reader or listener. A narrative is an account or series of events or experiences. In other words, a story is a series of experiences meant to grip the attention of the person experiencing the story. A story has a beginning and an end, and a middle full of conflict. Whether you agree or not, you have a beginning and an end, and a middle that is full of ups and downs and highs and lows and good times and bad times. A story has a protagonist, a primary character that it follows. You are the protagonist of <i>your</i> story, and you interact regularly with secondary characters that have influence on your day and what you do in it. Conversely, you play the role of a secondary character in the lives of many other people, some more than others.</p>
            <p>In Pulp Fiction, there are six relatively main characters. Now each of those individual characters follow their own narrative arc. Some overlap, some don’t. So it is with our lives. We all are the main character of our own life. We all are the center of our own world. We all are walking and talking stories.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Life as we know it now on earth is bloody and vulgar and brutal, just like the happenings of <i>Pulp Fiction</i>.
              <p>The word “fuck” is used 265 times. With 154 minutes of film, that’s an average of 1.7 uses of the word "fuck" a minute. Perhaps we are not all so vulgar in our own lives, but at the very least we all experience things that hold the capacity to frustrate us to a crude degree.</p>
              <p>Need I remind us of the brutal sexual violence against Marsellus Wallace, or car wreck, triple homicide, uzi-murder, overdose, restaurant hostage situation that takes place throughout the film? Life is this brutal to people. It’s utter mayhem out there. And on some level, everything humans do are attempts at distractions that ease this force of brute reality. No one can handle it alone, and so we all turn to either something or someone to relinquish our pain and suffering – whether it be some form of a drug, career, entertainment, a significant other, family, or a higher power...little do we know though that only one thing will completely and forever relinquish our pain and suffering - and that is Jesus Christ, what He did for us on the cross, and what He does for us now.</p>
              <p>We are all on this coarse river of life, and you can either learn how to fight the rapids the right way – with true effectiveness by the doing of Jesus Christ, or drown of exhaustion in the end – consumed by the chaos of the waves. Don't keep relying on fallible people in your life and unhelpful pursuits and objects - come to Jesus, and He will relinquish your pain and suffering forever - but you have to let Him...</p>
            </li>
            <li>Life will never go as you expect it, just like it went for the characters in <i>Pulp Fiction</i>.
              <p>There are essentially six primary characters that are followed throughout Pulp Fiction. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, Mia Wallace, Vincent Vega, Jules Winnfield, and Butch Coolidge. Bearing in mind that having unexpected things happen to your characters is also just a mark of good storytelling (because then your story resembles reality!), here are some good examples.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are the two misfits aiming to get money by robbing a place.
                  Here is some dialogue from the first scene of the movie.
                  <div class="courier">
                    <p>Pumpkin: “Nobody ever robs restaurants. Bars. Liquor stores. Gas stations. You get your head blown off stickin it in one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch them with their pants down. They’re not expecting to get robbed. Not as expecting, anyway.”</p>
                    <p>Honey Bunny: “I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this.”</p>
                    <p>Pumpkin: “Correct. Same as banks, these places are insured. Manager, he don’t give a fuck, he just tryin’ to get you out the door before you start pluggin’ the diners. Waitresses, fuckin’ forget it. No way they’re takin’ a bullet for the register. Bus boys, some wetbag gettin’ paid a dollar fifty an hour, really give a fuck you’re stealin’ from the owner. Customers sittin’ there with food in their mouths, they don’t know what’s goin’ on. One minute, they’re havin’ a Denver omelette, next minute, someone’s stickin’ a gun in their face.”</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Expectation: Pumpkin and Honey Bunny will not encounter any opposition or interference in their attempt to rob the restaurant.</p>
                  <p>Reality: They happen to rob a restaurant with experienced gangsters that do oppose and interfere with their operation.</p>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>Mia Wallace sits down with Vincent's coat on after a night out with Mr. Vega.
                  <p>Expectation: She is going to snort cocaine.</p>
                  <p>Reality: She ends up snorting heroin.</p>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>Butch Coolidge has just played the fight so that Marsellus Wallace loses, and is ready to escape with Fabienne, retire and live on an island.
                  <p>Expectation: Butch's plans to leave work out like he originally planned, and his father's watch is right where it needs to be.</p>
                  <p>Reality: Butch has the "singlehandedly strangest day of his life", after having to fetch his watch that Fabienne forgot, killing Vincent Vega, and running into Marsellus Wallace on the street at seeming coincidence.</p>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>Vincent Vega takes Mia Wallace out and swears the night will go smoothly.
                  <div class="courier">
                    <p>Vincent Vega: "What's her name again?"</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: "Mia. Why you so interested in big man's wife?"</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: "Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida and when he's gone, he wants me to take care of Mia."</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: "Take care of her?"</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: "Not that! Take her out. Show her a good time. Don't let her get lonely."</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: "You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?"</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: "It ain't a date. It's like when you and your buddy's wife go to a movie or somethin'. It's just...you know...good company."</p>
                    <p>Jules just looks at him.</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: "It's not a date."</p>
                    <p>Jules just looks at him.</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: "I'm not gonna be a bad boy."</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Expectation: Vincent's night out with Mia goes smoothly.</p>
                  <p>Reality: Mia overdoses on Vincent's heroin and Vincent has to administer adrenaline to her heart, barely escaping punishment from Marsellus for contributing to the death of his wife.</p>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li> Jules Winnfield encounters death but escapes alive. The fourth man storms into the room where Jules and Vincent are, expecting that everyone is accounted for.
                  <div class="courier">
                    <p>Fourth man: "Die...die...die...die...!"</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Peculiarly escaping the bullets, Vincent and Jules kill the fourth man and address the situation at hand.</p>
                  <div class ="courier">
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Why the fuck didn’t you tell us about that guy in the bathroom? Slip your mind? Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?”
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “We should be fuckin’ dead right now. Did you see that gun he fired at us? It was bigger than him.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “.357.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “We should be fuckin’ dead!”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Yeah, we were lucky.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “That shit wasn’t luck. That shit was somethin’ else.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Yeah, maybe.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “That was…divine intervention. You know what divine intervention is?”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Yeah, I think so. That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “Yeah, man, that’s what it means. That’s exactly what it means! God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “I think we should be going now.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “Don’t do that! Don’t you fuckin’ do that! Don’t blow this shit off! What just happened was a fuckin’ miracle!”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit happens.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn’t just happen.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “We should be fuckin’ dead now, my friend! We just witnessed a miracle, and I want you to fuckin’ acknowledge it!”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now?”</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Moments later after having entered the car:</p>
                  <div class="courier">
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “…ever seen that show ‘COPS’? I was watchin’ it once and this cop was on it who was talkin’ about this time he got into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway. He unloads on this guy and he doesn’t hit anything. And these guys were in a hallway. It’s a freak, but it happens.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “If you wanna play blind man, then go walk with a shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fuckin’ open.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “What the fuck does that mean?”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “That’s it for me. For here on in, you can consider my ass retired.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Jesus Christ!”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “Don’t blaspheme!”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Goddammit, Jules –- “</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “—I said don’t do that –“</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “ – you’re fuckin’ freakin’ out!”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “I’m tellin’ Marsellus today I’m through.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “While you’re at it, be sure to tell ‘im why.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “Don’t worry, I will.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “I’ll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he laughs his ass off.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “I don’t give a damn if he does.”</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Expectation: Jules Winnfield dies at the hand of the fourth man.</p>
                  <p>Reality: Either "God came down from heaven and stopped the bullets" or it was just a "freak occurrence", but Jules Winnfield is alive and well, for the time being.</p>
                </li>
                <br />
                  <p>So it is with us and our life. I guarantee you that you will be hit with the unexpected, and your life will never go quite as you wish it.</p>
                  <p>If there is anything we can take away from all these examples, it is that, in the end, when it is all said and done, life never happens like you would expect it to. How long must we, in our insanity, expect the same things to produce different results? How long will we have to expect and expect and expect? How long will we have to lie to ourselves until we realize that our own agenda and our own fantasies will never play out exactly like we want them to in life? How long will it take for us to realize that <i>this world that we are in is not about our own individual agendas and pursuits?</i></p>
                  <p>There is much greater work at play here. And there is a humble invitation out there for you to get involved in this great story like you were meant to. A story about love and death and life and redemption and living for others. The alternative is, naturally, living for oneself and then dying forever. Here’s the invitation. Right here:</p>
                  <p><u>Matthew 16:24-28</u></p>
                  <p>"Then said Jesus unto his disciples,
                    <div class="redletters">
                      <p>“If any <i>man</i> will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works. Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.”</p>
                    </div>
                  <p>That's it. This world is sinking and you will too. Unless you by faith join hands with the <i>only capable and true</i> person in history who knows the waters that this world is sinking in, is searching for those who want to <i>live</i> rather than go down with the ship, and promises to take you to shore Himself. All you have to do is genuinely follow Him.</p>

                <br />
              <li>There are too many "coincidences" in life for events and ourselves to be utterly random, just like how in <i>Pulp Fiction</i> the lives of the characters overlap at peculiar times.
                <p>A coincidence is defined as <i>a situation in which events happen at the same time in a way that is not planned or expected.</i>
                <p>List of prominent "coincidences" in <i>Pulp Fiction</i>:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Butch Coolidge comes into his apartment looking for his watch when Vincent Vega is on the toilet, able to use Vincent’s uzi to kill Mr. Vega.</li>
                    <li>Butch Coolidge runs into Marsellus Wallace on the way back to Fabienne as Marsellus Wallace crosses the street in front of him.</li>
                    <li>Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield evade the bullets from the “goddam hand-cannon” at the hand of the fourth man.</li>
                    <li>The one diner that Pumpkin and Honey Bunny decide to rob, thinking it will be easy because the lack of prepared people in a restaurant, is serving prepared gangsters that end up interfering.</li>
                    <li>The one gun store that Butch runs into while fleeing from Marsellus, is owned and operated by two serial rapists that kidnap both Marsellus and Butch for an afternoon.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>What is key to recognize here is how a number of coincidences like the above can easily <i>appear</i> as mere coincidence. But what is the actual case? All of these situations were orchestrated by the author of the story - in this case, Quentin Tarantino - in order to tell a <i>greater</i> story, a story that utilizes the interwoven stories of the six main characters in question - Pumpkin, Honey Bunny, Mia, Butch, Vincent, and Jules - to tell a higher and fuller and more captivating and awe-inspiring narrative (in this case, the narrative has a name: <i>Pulp Fiction</i>).</p>
                <p>So it is with this world we share. The millions of coincidences that we partake in across our lifetime has such greater impact than one who believes in randomness would think. There is order to the chaos around us, and the order can only be discerned when you understand that a much greater story is being told around you, and that <i>you</i> have the privilege to be a part of it.</p>
                <p>Now this is not a perfect metaphor for how reality is to us, but it is close:</p>
                <p>Does Butch know that he is playing a role in a movie that was created by Quentin Tarantino? Of course not – he’s busy being Butch. Does Jules know that he is playing a role in a movie that was created by Quentin Tarantino? No, he doesn’t know the full story. But he is aware that something greater than himself saved him from those bullets. He just hasn’t realized who God is and why He stopped those bullets. Jules Winnfield doesn’t know just yet that Jules Winnfield’s god is Quentin Tarantino and Quentin stopped those bullets from hitting Jules <i>and</i> Vincent in the name of a greater story.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Does the reader of these words right now know that he or she is playing a role in the great story of life that is orchestrated by the Great Composer of All Creation? That depends – either you, the reader, know the Lord and see how the Lord gives proper place, time, and opportunity to all things for His greater purpose, or you, the reader, do not know the Lord on some critical level and are busy being you. Which is fine. By all means, go and be “you”.</p>
            <p>But know that this world is full of evil <i>because</i> of our effort, by our God-given free will, to create and facilitate our own role in the movie of life rather than trust the author of all humanity to give people the best lines and the best course of action. This horrible, chaotic, evil world as we know it exists because humans do as they see fit and not as God sees fit.</p>
            <p>Because here’s the catch. God knows what is best for us. AND WE DON’T HAVE A CLUE, left alone to our own logic. We either trust ourselves (which is what leads to the world we are in now – an evil, ignorant, self-loathing, self-gratifying, self-seeking world), or we trust in God (which is how God intended us to live).</p>
            <p>Because God saw that it was good, He created man <i>in His image</i>, to be in relationship with Him. We are built for the company of God. It is why no amount of fame or worldly honor or glory or personal conquests achieved, we ever are truly satisfied. God knows this, and those that know Him, because of the depravity of man, know how desperately we <i>all</i> need Him.</p>
            <p>Here is a glimpse of what the future holds for those that choose to trust in God rather than themselves. I’m screamin’ at you, man. This is what comes at the end of the show. This is the third and final act:</p>
            <p><u>Revelations 21</u></p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,” for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”</p>
              </div>
            <p>This is the closest look at God we will ever get <i>physically</i>, before the death of our earthly bodies:</p>
            <p><u>Revelations 1</u></p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands, and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters. In his right hand, he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance. When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.”</p>
              </div>
            <p>And here is where those who trusted in Him will dwell:</p>
            <p><u>Revelations 21</u></p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it. Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.</p>
              </div>
            <p>Us humans are apt at clinching our own fate, so I know that some part of you is wondering, if all this nonsense isn’t made-up fiction after all, how do we know whether our name is on Jesus Christ’s book of life?</p>
            <p><u>Romans 10:9</u></p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.</p>
              </div>
            <p>And of course, you know your security and identity in Christ by faith:</p>
            <p><u>Hebrews 11:1-40</u></p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. This is what the ancients were commended for.</p>
                <p>By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.</p>
                <p>By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith he was commended as righteous, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead.</p>
                <p>By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: “He could not be found, because God had taken him away.” For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.</p>
                <p>By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith.</p>
                <p>By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. And by faith even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was enabled to bear children because she considered him faithful who had made the promise. And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.</p>
                <p>All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. Instead, they were longing for a better country – a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.</p>
                <p>By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, even though God had said to him, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.” Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of speaking he did receive Isaac back from death.</p>
                <p>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.</p>
                <p>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph’s sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.</p>
                <p>By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his bones.</p>
                <p>By faith Moses’ parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict.</p>
                <p>By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. By faith he kept the Passover and the application of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.</p>
                <p>By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.</p>
                <p>By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the army had marched around them for seven days.</p>
                <p>By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.</p>
                <p>And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson and Jephthah, about David and Samuel and the prophets, who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. Women received back their dead, raised to life again. There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection. Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were put to death by stoning; they were sawed in two; they were killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated – the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and in holes in the ground.</p>
                <p>These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised, since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.</p>

            <p>You may be convinced of your own view of the world, and I totally respect that. But I'm here to tell you - there is something very unique about the love and relationship provided by Jesus Christ, there is something very special about pure and real faith in Him, and, lest your soul turn to dust in some odd 80 years, I implore you to seek Him for yourself. What you really want - deep and resilient, undying love, righteous experience, clarity and understanding, pure desires - it's all found in Him.</p>
            <p>And because of this truth - I'm tellin' you - you're in a 3D life-size very realistic movie, my friend, and one day the credits will roll, and you will remember that you have been sitting in a theater <i>this entire time</i>, and you will be confronted with hard truths like "Was I the best protagonist I could be?" and "Did I tell a good story through my actions and words and life?" and "Did I do my part in the actual movie of <i>LIFE</i> writ large, or was I caught up drinking from wells that will run dry and kill me of thirst in the end?"</p>
            <p>And there will be many who rejoice in love and many who shriek in terror when the credits roll.</p>

    <h2><u>PART 4 - LUCIDITY THROUGH LIVIDITY</u></h2>
    <p>"The lucidity that was to constitute his torture at the same time crowns his victory."
      <p> - Albert Camus, <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>
    <p>With the rage of a thousand bulls, Sisyphus starts again - up his known mountain, every step strenuous, every direction asunder.</p>
    <p>Here's how it happened:</p>
    <p>I was strolling down a garden of decaying fruit when it struck me: Only something that is eternal can be truly meaningful.</p>
    <p>Only that which lasts actually matters.</p>
    <p>I was swept up in experience and then I perceived that experience does not live on - for death comes to all that experience. And so, I asked myself, for at the end of the day, all we have is ourselves, "What matters in the end?", bearing in mind that all experience ends and therefore does not appear to matter. I perceived that what was written may matter for what is written lives on past oneself. So I scribbled for days and days, thinking to myself, <i>I will write and write and people will know and feel what they read from me is good and true and to be listened to. Then they will see my heart for what it is, they will know the humanity within me and they will see me for who I am, not this odd robe of flesh I'm stuck in.</i> But then I found the Book of Truth and realized everything that needed to be said had been said and nothing newly written would ever achieve the insurmountable specialness that this Book of Truth, which is the Holy Bible, held. But I decided I may as well write anyway. But, behold, after I am dead and gone, and though my words may live on a little while longer, those future people will perish and their experience will be no more. And I hated life for I saw everything is done in vain. And I perceived that I was dust and to be returned to dust and I was not needed for people perished just fine on their own without me, and I was not necessary for God like He is for Himself and His people. No, I perceived what I was - a body of dust, full of an empty spirit, pining for water to live another day so that I could be thirsty so that I may find water again to live another day so that I could be thirsty so that I could live a nice bundle of days so that I could die. I could live a nice bundle of days engineered by God, and then keel over and die and be no more. And I hated life for having death and I hated people for not seeing the reality of death and nothing made sense any more for this is the message of the wisest man of earth: <b>All is vanity</b>. And so I became first despondent and then livid and then despondent again at the prospect of my pointlessness.
    </p>
    <p>And my memory was squashed by the weight of the world...</p>
    <p>And I perceived the frailty of the human mind and the weakness of the human heart and the vanity of myself, alone, to do good. And I wanted to never have known that such evil was possible in reality, even if that meant never having been born.</p>
    <p>I knew not whether it was better to gasp for air in this lifeless vortex or drown in some sort of sunken sorrow...</p>
    <p>For I saw then how all my ways were vanity, all my efforts fruitless, and my ultimate destiny out of my control.</p>
    <p>I cried out in despair:</p>
      <p>"Oh where, oh where is the rhyme and reason</p>
      <p>to Chaos and Mayhem which are my seasons?"</p>
    <p>But, the great truth of reality drew me in like a whirlpool...</p>
    <p>Behold, you see, I was fast asleep, but then I woke up from my vain slumber, for my Dad had called me to check in. I said I would be at His house earlier, but I stayed asleep because it is easy and natural.</p>
    <p>I loathe sleeping now, knowing that I could've been awake and alive and on my way to my Father's house.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>There once was a Father and His children. They were flying high above the earth and engaged in riveting conversation. They both gazed down upon the earth, and saw the flames of sin enveloping the midst of all people.</p>
    <p>The Father said to His child, "All the light that you see I give to you".</p>
    <p>The world said, eyes brimming with fear, "Where exactly?"</p>
    <p>And I said, <i><b><u>Why?</u></b></i></p>
    <p>And that has made all the difference.</p>
    <p>Because: You're a philosopher the moment you first ask "Why?"</p>
    <p>And through philosophical study, I determined:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The very fact that we are motivated to do anything (that we succumb to boredom so easily) is evidence that there is some sort of meaning to life (hence, the meaning of life cannot be nothing). Motivation, whether conscious or subconscious, is purpose. And we are all motivated to accomplish certain purposes. And the right kind of purpose is truly meaningful.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>If the meaning of life isn't, say, a phrase or a certain object. Then the fact that it's not <i>that specific thing</i> means that there is a meaning to life. If you can say "the meaning of life is not this specific object", then it follows that there is something that you can point to that <i>is</i> the meaning of life (even if, in your opinion, you point that meaning to nothing).</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>The meaning of Life is not me. So why would I make the meaning of <i>my</i> life about me? The meaning of my individual life ought to align with the meaning of the totality of Life, if indeed it can be done.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>All spectrums of experience are stretched too far for there not to be something greater than ourselves at work in our midst. Seriously, just look around. The complexity, the simplicity, the depth, the beauty of it all. If you see nothing worth being in awe about, you're missing something. Every experience that every human being has had is bathed in divine beauty - perceiving that underlying beauty is simply a matter of the heart.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>And so it dawned on me that there must be a grand meaning of life, for:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I knew that living for self-gain was curiously and totally in vain, so in order to pursue something of real merit or worth, one must pursue that something as selflessly as possible. In other words, there exists a peculiar specialness to doing selfless things and being selfless while the natural and easy thing to do is to live and act selfishly.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I knew there was a beauty that pervades all things, and I knew this beauty had to have come from somewhere. Total and complete randomness/lawlessness does not produce beauty - it produces chaos. Therefore, because there is beauty, there is at least some degree of order. For if there was no order to life, then how could any of it be beautiful?</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I had tasted real, upright, undying, lasting, sincere <i>goodness</i> - something that could not exist on its own in an evil world that was set to be extinguished forever.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>And so I was fascinated by all things and sought to understand myself, and the human condition, and the truth of our reality in full.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>"Almost nothing important that ever happens to you happens because you engineer it. Destiny has no beeper; destiny always leans trenchcoated out of an alley with some sort of psst that you usually can't even hear because you're in such a rush to or from something important that you've tried to engineer."</p>
      <p> - David Foster Wallace, <i>Infinite Jest</i></p>
    <p>I awoke and perceived some part of me had been stabbed. My heart, mightily punctured, bled its course. In the frenzy of bleeding out, I had a subconscious epiphany that I needed truth. So frantically I went through what was in front of me, confident that a syringe full of truth serum would fill my bleeding heart. I pounded on the door of the universe, demanding from the gutters of my throat, begging "Where are the truth serums? I know they are there! I demand truth! Give me truth!"</p>
    <p>If you didn't know the state of my heart, you'd think me an obnoxious loon.</p>
    <p>And lo and behold, through the eternal moments of silence that seemed to consume me, the universe did answer me.</p>
    <p>The universe responded to me.</p>
    <p>It pounded on the door of my mind, demanding from the heights of its voice, commanding, "Give me life! Give me life!"</p>
    <p>If you didn't know the depths of its love, you'd think the universe evil.</p>
    <p>And lo and behold, in exemplifying the very opposite of obnoxious evil, the universe kneeled to its knees and raised its arms up to me in proposal. And, consumed by the fire of love, the only true element of the universe, I said yes, and I gave the universe my life, and it gave me truth and all that that entails.</p>
    <p>And then it hit me.</p>
    <h3><b><i>I am blessed to perceive that all life is a love story being told by the Creator to His created.</i></b></h3>
    <p>And an abundance of other truths hit me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I perceived that I could stay in the system and talk and talk and talk or dropout and actually listen to people.</li>
      <li>*</li>
      <li>I perceived that all men and likewise myself sought to be understood and that it was the whole duty of mine to be a voice for the misunderstood. For too many are guilty of misunderstanding what ought to be understood. And what ought to be understood is this:
        <ul>
          <li>There is no act a man can commit that does not merit my forgiveness, especially when I know that the Lord forgives all sin for those that believe in Him.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>Love – of the true and pure and real sort - is imperative to have for all people in your life. It is imperative because of how good it is – both for the one loving and the loved ones.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>The intrinsic beauty of the moment is total and wonderful and worthy of a righteous and praiseworthy awe.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I perceived that you only fear something other than God if you don't comprehend the big picture. I perceived that you only fail to love and forgive someone if you don't know God and what He did for you, and the power of His love.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that all those who sought abortions had been born themselves, and, behold, the voice of the unborn was unheard, squashed by the souls of the selfish. For the born sought to destroy the unborn and did not know the evil that they committed, squashing the voices of the unborn – for if the unborn could speak, I have a hunch they would scream for life.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that the love of wealth and materialism in America stems from a certain love for life. Although it is horrifically unfounded, currently off course and off balance in a very morbid way.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that <i>all negative judgment stems from the insecurity of the judger that sees difference in the judged and, recognizing the multitude of differences between oneself and the other, in defense of what oneself is, deems the judged in a negative light to reassure themselves that what they are doing and who they are is in a positive light</i>. For who are we to know the mind and the heart of any individual but ourselves? And this common human occurrence begs a very real philosophical question – why are we drawn to paint ourselves in this positive light, even to such a degree that we feel compelled to tarnish the light of others?</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that all we do we do in order to have the best meal possible, the best experience within our reach, one that tastes out of this world, one that gives us the necessary fuel to accomplish whatever we set out to do, one that is shared with deeply close friends, one that is a celebration of life in its purest form. Then I knew that this meal of an experience was coming, and it had its time and place and guest list, and <b>right now the invitation is out, but the doors will slam shut at some point, for the master of the feast knows best when and how to entertain those that have accepted his call for love and life and wonderful community.</b></li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that I was unfit for conventionalism.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that all things that are not attached to eternity pass away forever and ultimately hold no value.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that all people want the same thing and it is our story as a people to pursue that same thing in different ways. One way really does lead to us having that thing. All others fall short.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that life is meant to be lived to the fullest and that there are many forces at play actively working to stop you from living life the way it is meant to be lived.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that even perception is fallible, like our hearts.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that <div class="markerfelt">fantasy</div> is the <div class="phosphate">truth</div> of this <div class="chalkduster">dream</div>
            <ul>
              <li>Define: Fantasy = the reality of imagination.</li>
              <li>Define: Imagination = the brain's freedom.</li>
              <li>Define: Freedom = anything you choose to describe it
                <ul>
                  <li>Therefore, the reality of the brain's choice is the truth of this dream. In other words, your reality will match however you <i>choose</i> to perceive reality, but pray that however you choose to perceive reality accurately correlates to <div class="phosphate">objective reality</div></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>And it was like, though the thunder roared around me and the rain poured ceaselessly, all I could see were these flashes of brilliance, these aphorisms of lightning, this internal clarity despite blatant external confusion. And this is what I saw:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We are here to be taught to trust God over ourselves. Because of sin, we trust the life that we make for ourselves instead of what is infinitely better, the life that God provides for us.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>Man is a little less evil when he stops gazing down with arrogance at the inadequacy of others and starts staring up with wonder at the beauty of the inadequacy of others and shouts with glee, "Truly you are superior! And at the very least, my equal!"</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>The biggest mistake in history was disobeying God. The biggest mistake we currently make is disobeying God.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>"Sex is what dogs do on the side of the street. The intimacy and love and connection I have with my wife when we make love cannot be called that." Sin seeks to convince you of the lie that indulging in sin is living life to the full when the true tragedy is that it is robbing you of that fullness. Fullness is lived God's way.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>I perceived that all human desire ends with emotional stimulus. Based on my experience and faith, I know God is what we all desire. We are meant to engage in relationship with God. And so we all strive for emotional stimulus that is, reflects, or is close to God. We all long for praise, no matter where it comes from. We all long to satisfy and act on things that lead to who we want to be. But that glory is selfish. And in the most humbling paradox of all, abandoning selfish aspirations will lead you to exactly what you thought those selfish aspirations would accomplish – life, love, success, wealth, health, fullness – whatever it is you truly desire - it is found in Jesus Christ and all given to you by Him according to His good will.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>There are two paths. One is accepting the grace of Jesus Christ and realizing that you will never be good enough on your own and that you need God to be good. The other is that you worship some other idol that lies to you and claims that if you work or do or be a certain way, then you are good enough or that you will then be satisfied. One is the path of truth and God. The other is the path of lies and the self. How long will it take each of us to realize that on our own we go nowhere and do no good thing? You either live for God or you live for yourself. One of those will lead to life. The other death.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>This is the life that Jesus yearns to give us: a life consumed by beautiful livelihood, fullness of love, and betterment of self.</li>
        </ul
        <p>***</p>
        <p>I am imperfect and have sinned many times. In truth, I do not know people like my Father - like not even close - and therefore it is imperative that I refrain from judgment upon all others, and espouse love, like my Father has said. But in loving the Father, we inevitably come to follow His commandments.</p>
        <p>And so with love in mind, consider these:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Just like scientific theories are models that have not been thwarted by experimentation, so too does the literature of the bible stand up to my reality. And of course, inevitably, surpasses so much more.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>Sure, the message of novels can be summed up to be a sentence or two. But hearing a sentence doesn’t even scrape the surface of understanding that your mind can handle. A novel allows the message to not just be severely unknown, but allows it to soak in the mind, leading to knowing the true weight of that slender sentence summary. The same rule applies to why we live a lifetime and not a moment. It's simply better to learn from a lifetime than a moment.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>The meaning of anything is whatever the creator of that something wants it to be. Yes, interpreters are free to interpret. But that does not change the original and authoritative intention of the created piece.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>It's like I woke up from a trance, excited to realize that I had been performing on a stage for a nonexistent audience, and eager to step off stage to a truer reality. Humbled by my awakening, I yearned to call back to my colleagues on stage and scream at them the truth: "You're acting!!! You're performing!!! Can't you see that you have given yourself into some vain game that has sought to control your mind and tragically succeeded? What are you seeking when you do well at the games in your head?" But, alas, no words could reach them, for uncovered fears roamed the caverns of their mind and held tight to the reigns of their will, convincing them to play a false role on a fake stage, despite truth being in them and around them, mere steps away. Saddened by the blindness of the world, I exited stage left and hurried home to true love.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>Life is like a roller coaster. And we can see the roller coasters of others. I am turning my attention away from the roller coasters of others and focusing on my own ride. And only then will I be able to fully enjoy it!</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>And I dreamt that some generation would come from the shadows and save us and sanctify us but behold no one came because no one knows, no, not one, but Him. And I perceived that I could do nothing but change myself, although I wanted every person I met to share in this secret joy that came from the Lord. All I can do is nudge, is put up a sign, is write the message that I believe in. And those that want to hear truth will work to understand truth and those that want to be confused or comfortable in their own ways will remain so.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>I know that life is a puzzle. And year by year, I am slowly accumulating the pieces, and in some decade, by God, I am going to put enough of the pieces of the puzzle together, not to complete it, but to get the gist of the picture.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>The Creator of the universe knocks on one's door. And they slam it in His face.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>When a book is written, it is constant and unchanging in its truth. What shifts is the mind of the interpreter upon digesting the book, not the book itself. The book is still objectively true, although there are perceived subjective truths about it. So it is with the bible.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>You can't quantify something that invented quantity as we know it.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>How fascinating is it that no matter what we think, say, or do, we have a philosophy, our very own worldview, that we employ as we live out our lives…</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>Life is absurd? Of course life is absurd - without God. With God, life is nothing but gorgeous. Not choosing God is absurd. Anything without God is absurd. Think of the futility of life without God, how all your experience is null post-death, and you will realize how He is the only thing that is sensible.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>Religion is a crutch for the weak? God is created for human needs?...These accusations are amiss. You may die with your pride and your illusion of freedom while I will live with my God. Oh but this is such a loaded thought – for it is not religion I have found, it is relationship, and my past life dwelling in sin was my crutch for reality but now I have no need to lean on any of that for God makes me upright and always strong in Him. I correct your statement here: Sin is a crutch for the dying. And the uniform qualities of human needs point to the God-sized hole in each of our hearts.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>We live in a utopia already. Due to the power of our mind that has been given to us, whatever we seek, we will find. Whatever we want, we will have. You claim that your wants and desires are not met in this world? You naïve sloth. If you truly wanted something, then you would find it. What is everyone's dilemma is that they think that they know what they want (sin), when in reality what they truly want is quite different (God).</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>If genuine life advice sounds cliché, that's because the best way to go about life has been uncovered. Do you really think that over the course of all human lives, no one is yet to understand it succinctly, life's inner workings to only be revealed when you showed up through some "original" and "creative" new-age aphorism? Nothing is new under the sun. People have died believing in the truth. People have died believing in lies. People are living today believing in the truth. People are living today believing in lies.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>I have walked down the same road my entire life. Everything has been recognizable. But I am not dismayed at how you think it is all the same because of who I walk down the road with. That is the difference between you and me. I want you to know my companion, for he makes everything glisten with newness. My friend that leads me down this straightforward road makes every flower smell greater than the one before, every step more fulfilling than the last, every breath more present than the fleeting past.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>First, as children we know nothing. But then we learn how to behave from our surroundings. How to go our own way. And a constant and consistent battle in our being is justifying ourselves. We need validation from somewhere, and we behave in a certain way to obtain that which we so desperately need. Perhaps true adulthood is forgiving others and likewise ourselves as we all trip and fall on our way to peaceful validation, and letting everyone swim their own stroke, however far they wish, not criticizing them for being unlike our specific stroke and length, but rather just being sure they don't drown.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And there is a sweet irony right here and throughout all of this. All that I despise about society and the world and the evil I've witnessed in others I must forgive, because all the evil in the world that I find despicable is also within me.</p>
        <p>And now I borrow a passage from the brilliant mind of W. Somerset Maugham, which shines more light on the message of lucidity I wish to share with you.</p>

        <div class="STZhongsong">
        <h3><i>CHAPTER TWO</i></h3>
        <p><i>(i)</i></p>
        <p>I DID not see Elliott till he came to London towards the end of June in the following year. I asked him whether Larry had after all gone to Paris. He had. I was faintly amused at Elliott's exasperation with him.</p>
        <p>"I had a kind of sneaking sympathy for the boy. I couldn't blame him for wanting to spend a couple of years in Paris and I was prepared to launch him. I told him to let me know the moment he arrived, but it was only when Louisa wrote and told me he was there that I knew he'd come. I wrote to him care of the American Express, which was the address she gave me, and asked him to come and dine to meet some of the people I thought he ought to know; I thought I'd try him out first with the Franco-American set, Emily de Montadour and Gracie de Chateau-Gaillard and so on, and d'you know what he answered? He said he was sorry he couldn't come, but he hadn't brought any evening clothes with him."</p>
        <p>Elliott looked me full in the face to see the stupefaction with which he expected this communication to fill me. He raised a supercilious eyebrow when he observed that I took it with calm.</p>
        <p>"He replied to my letter on a sheet of nasty paper with the heading of a cafe in the Latin Quarter and when I wrote back I asked him to let me know where he was staying. I felt I must do something about him for Isabel's sake, and I thought perhaps he was shy—I mean I couldn't believe that any young fellow in his senses could come to Paris without evening clothes, and in any case there are tolerable tailors there, so I asked him to lunch and said it would be quite a small party, and would you believe it, not only did he ignore my request to give me some other address than the American Express, but he said he never ate luncheon. That finished him as far as I was concerned."</p>
        <p>"I wonder what he's been doing with himself."</p>
        <p>"I don't know, and to tell you the truth I don't care.</p>
        <p>I'm afraid he's a thoroughly undesirable young man and I think it would be a great mistake for Isabel to marry him. After all, if he led a normal sort of life I'd have ran across him at the Ritz bar or at Fouquet's or somewhere."</p>
        <p>I go sometimes to these fashionable places myself, but I go to others also, and it happened that I spent several days in Paris early in the autumn of that year on my way to Marseilles, where I was proposing to take one of the Messagerie ships for Singapore. I dined one evening with friends in Montparaasse and after dinner we went to the Dome to drink a glass of beer. Presently my wandering eye caught sight of Larry sitting by himself at a little marble-topped table on the crowded terrace. He was looking idly at the people who strolled up and down enjoying the coolness of the night after a sultry day. I left my party and went up to him. His face lit up when he saw me and he gave me an engaging smile. He asked me to sit down, but I said I couldn't as I was with a party.</p>
        <p>"I just wanted to say how d'you do to you," I said.</p>
        <p>"Are you staying here?" he asked.</p>
        <p>"Only for a very few days."</p>
        <p>"Will you lunch with me tomorrow?"</p>
        <p>"I thought you never lunched."</p>
        <p>He chuckled.</p>
        <p>"You've seen Elliott. I don't generally, I can't afford the time, I just have a glass of milk and a brioche, but I'd like you to dine with me."</p>
        <p>"All right."</p>
        <p>We arranged to meet at the Dome next day to have an aperitif and eat at some place on the boulevard. I rejoined my friends. We sat on talking. When next I looked for Larry he had gone.</p>

        <p><i>(ii)</i></p>
        <p>I spent the next morning very pleasantly. I went to the Luxembourg and passed an hour looking at some pictures I liked. Then I strolled in the gardens, recapturing the memories of my youth. Nothing had changed. They might have been the same students who walked along the gravel paths in pairs, eagerly discussing the writers who excited them. They might have been the same children who trundled the same hoops under the watchful eyes of the same nurses. They might have been the same old men who basked in the sunshine, reading the morning paper.</p>
        <p>They might have been the same middle-aged women in mourning who sat on the free benches and gossiped with one another about the price of food and the misdeeds of servants. Then I went to the Odeon and looked at the new books in the galleries and I saw the lads who like myself thirty years before were trying under the petulant eyes of the smock-frocked attendants to read as much as they could of books they could not afford to buy. Then I strolled leisurely along those dear, dingy streets till I came to the Boulevard du Montparnasse and so to the Dome. Larry was waiting. We had a drink and walked along to a restaurant where we could lunch in the open air.</p>
        <p>He was perhaps a little paler than I remembered him and this made his very dark eyes, in their deep orbits, more striking; but he had the same self-possession, curious in one so young, and the same ingenuous smile. When he ordered his lunch I noticed that he spoke French fluently and with a good accent. I congratulated him on it.</p>
        <p>"I knew a certain amount of French before, you know," he explained. "Aunt Louisa had a French governess for Isabel, and when they were at Marvin she used to make us talk French with her all the time."</p>
        <p>I asked him how he liked Paris.</p>
        <p>"Very much."</p>
        <p>"D'you live in Montparnasse?"</p>
        <p>"Yes," he said, after a moment's hesitation which I interpreted into a disinclination to tell exactly where he lived.</p>
        <p>"Elliott was rather put out that the only address you gave was the American Express."</p>
        <p>Larry smiled but did not answer.</p>
        <p>"What do you do with yourself all the time?"</p>
        <p>"I loaf."</p>
        <p>"And you read?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, I read."</p>
        <p>"Do you ever hear from Isabel?"</p>
        <p>"Sometimes. We're neither of us great letter-writers. She's having a grand time in Chicago. They're coming over next year to stay with Elliott."</p>
        <p>"That'll be nice for you."</p>
        <p>"I don't believe Isabel's ever been to Paris. It'll be fun taking her around."</p>
        <p>He was curious to know about my journey in China and listened attentively to what I told him; but when I tried to get him to talk about himself, I failed. He was so uncommunicative that I was forced to the conclusion that he had asked me to lunch with him merely to enjoy my company. I was pleased, but baffled. We had no sooner finished our coffee than he called for the bill, paid it and got up.</p>
        <p>"Well, I must be off," he said.</p>
        <p>We parted. I knew no more of what he was up to than before. I did not see him again.</p>

        <p><i>(iii)</i></p>
        <p>I was not in Paris in the spring when, sooner than they had planned, Mrs. Bradley and Isabel arrived to stay with Elliott; and again I have to eke out my knowledge of what passed during the few weeks they spent there by the exercise of my imagination. They landed at Cherbourg and Elliott, always considerate, went to meet them. They passed through the customs. The train started. Elliott with some complacency told them that he had engaged a very good lady's maid to look after them and when Mrs. Bradley said that was quite unnecessary, since they didn't need one, he was very sharp with her.</p>
        <p>"Don't be tiresome the moment you arrive, Louisa. No one can be well turned out without a maid, and I've engaged Antoinette not only for your sake and Isabel's but for mine. It would mortify me that you shouldn't be perfectly dressed."</p>
        <p>He gave the clothes they were wearing a disparaging glance.</p>
        <p>"Of course you'll want to buy some new frocks. On mature consideration I've come to the conclusion that you can't do better than Chanel."</p>
        <p>"I always used to go to Worth," said Mrs. Bradley.</p>
        <p>She might as well not have spoken, for he took no notice.</p>
        <p>"I've talked to Chanel myself and I've made an appointment for you tomorrow at three. Then there are hats. Obviously Reboux."</p>
        <p>"I don't want to spend a lot of money, Elliott."</p>
        <p>"I know. I am proposing to pay for everything myself. I'm determined that you shall be a credit to me. Oh, and Louisa, I've arranged several parties for you and I've told my French friends that Myron was an ambassador, which, of course, he would have been if he'd lived a little longer, and it makes a better effect. I don't suppose it'll come up, but I thought I'd better warn you."</p>
        <p>"You're ridiculous, Elliott."</p>
        <p>"No, I'm not. I know the world. I know that the widow of an ambassador has more prestige than the widow of a minister." As the train steamed into the Gare du Nord, Isabel, who was standing at the window, called out: "There's Larry."</p>
        <p> It had hardly stopped when she sprang out and ran to meet him. He threw his arms around her.</p>
        <p>"How did he know you were coming?" Elliott asked his sister acidly.</p>
        <p>"Isabel wirelessed him from the ship."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley kissed him affectionately, and Elliott gave him a limp hand to shake. It was ten o'clock at night.</p>
        <p>"Uncle Elliott, can Larry come to lunch tomorrow?" cried Isabel, her arm in the young man's, her face eager and her eyes shining.</p>
        <p>"I should be charmed, but Larry has given me to understand that he doesn't eat lunch."</p>
        <p>"He will tomorrow, won't you, Larry?"</p>
        <p>"I will," he smiled.</p>
        <p>"I shall look forward to seeing you at one o'clock then."</p>
        <p>He stretched out his hand once more, intending to dismiss him, but Larry grinned at him impudently.</p>
        <p>"I'll help with the luggage and get a cab for you."</p>
        <p>"My car is waiting and my man will see to the luggage," said Elliott with dignity.</p>
        <p>"That's fine. Then all we've got to do is to go. If there's room for me I'll come as far as your door with you."</p>
        <p>"Yes, do, Larry," said Isabel.</p>
        <p>They walked down the platform together, followed by Mrs. Bradley and Elliott. Elliott's face bore a look of frigid disapproval.</p>
        <p>"Quelles manières," he said to himself, for in certain circumstances he felt he could express his sentiments more forcibly in French.</p>
        <p>Next morning at eleven, having finished dressing, for he was not an early riser, he sent a note to his sister, via his man Joseph and her maid Antoinette, to ask her to come to the library so that they could have a talk. When she appeared he closed the door carefully and, putting a cigarette into an immensely long agate holder, lit it and sat down.</p>
        <p>"Am I to understand that Isabel and Larry are still engaged?" he asked.</p>
        <p>"So far as I know."</p>
        <p>"I'm afraid I haven't a very good account to give you of the young man." He told her then how he had been prepared to launch him in society and the plans he had made to establish him in a fit and proper manner. "I even had my eye on a rez-de-chaussée that would have been the very thing for him. It belongs to the young Marquis de Rethel and he wanted to sublet it because he'd been appointed to the embassy at Madrid."</p>
        <p>But Larry had refused his invitations in a manner that made it quite clear that he did not want his help.</p>
        <p>"What the object of coming to Paris is if you're not going to take advantage of what Paris has to give you is beyond my comprehension. I don't know what he does with himself. He doesn't seem to know anybody. Do you know where he lives?"</p>
        <p>"The only address we've ever had is the American Express."</p>
        <p>"Like a travelling salesman or a school-teacher on vacation, I shouldn't be surprised if he was living with some little trollop in a studio in Montmartre."</p>
        <p>"Oh, Elliott."</p>
        <p>"What other explanation can there be for the mystery he's making of his dwelling place and for his refusal to consort with people of his own class?"</p>
        <p>"It doesn't sound like Larry. And last night, didn't you get the impression that he was just as much in love with Isabel as ever? He couldn't be so false."</p>
        <p>Elliott by a shrug of the shoulders gave her to understand that there was no limit to the duplicity of men.</p>
        <p>"What about Gray Maturin? Is he still in the picture?"</p>
        <p>"He'd marry Isabel tomorrow if she'd have him."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley told him then why they had to come to Europe sooner than they had at first intended. She had found herself in ill-health, and the doctors had informed her that she was suffering from diabetes. It was not serious, and by attention to her diet and taking moderate doses of insulin there was no reason why she should not live for a good many years, but the knowledge that she had an incurable disease made her anxious to see Isabel settled. They had talked the matter over. Isabel was sensible. She had agreed that if Larry refused to come back to Chicago at the end of the two years in Paris they had agreed upon and get a job, there was only one thing to do and that was to break with him. But it offended Mrs. Bradley's sense of personal dignity that they should wait till the appointed time and then come to fetch him, like a fugitive from justice, back to his own country. She felt that Isabel would put herself in a humiliating position. But it was very natural that they should spend the summer in Europe, where Isabel had not been since she was a child. After their visit in Paris they could go to some watering-place suitable to Mrs. Bradley's complaint, then on to the Austrian Tyrol for a while and from there travel slowly through Italy. Mrs. Bradley's intention was to ask Larry to accompany them, so that he and Isabel could see whether the long separation had left their feelings unchanged. It would be manifest in due course whether Larry, having had his fling, was prepared to accept the responsibilities of life.
        </p>
        <p>"Henry Maturin was sore with him for turning down the position he offered him, but Gray has talked him round, and he can go into the business the moment he comes back to Chicago."</p>
        <p>"Gray's a very nice fellow."</p>
        <p>"He certainly is." Mrs. Bradley sighed. "I know he'd make Isabel happy."</p>
        <p>Elliott then told her what parties he had arranged for them. He was giving a big luncheon on the following day and at the end of the week; a grand dinner party. He was taking them to a reception at the Château-Gaillards and he had got cards for them to a ball that the Rothschilds were giving.</p>
        <p>"You'll ask Larry, won't you?"</p>
        <p>"He tells me he hasn't any evening clothes," Elliott sniffed.</p>
        <p>"Well, ask him all the same. After all, he is a nice boy, and it wouldn't help to give him the cold shoulder. It would only make Isabel obstinate."</p>
        <p>"Of course I'll ask him if you wish it."</p>
        <p>Larry came to lunch at the appointed time, and Elliott, whose manners were admirable, was pointedly cordial to him. It was not difficult, since Larry was so gay, in such high spirits that it would have needed a much more ill-natured man than Elliott not to be charmed with him. The conversation dealt with Chicago and their common friends there, so that there was not much for Elliott to do other than to look amiable and pretend to be interested in the concerns of persons whom he thought of no social consequence. He did not mind listening; indeed, he thought it rather touching to hear them tell of this young couple's engagement, that young couple's marriage, and another young couple's divorce. Who had ever heard of them? He knew that that pretty little Marquise de Clinchant had tried to poison herself because her lover, the Prince de Colombey, had left her to marry the daughter of a South American millionaire. That was something to talk about. Looking at Larry, he was obliged to admit that there was something peculiarly attractive in him; with his deep-set strangely black eyes, his high cheekbones, pale skin and mobile mouth he reminded Elliott of a portrait by Botticelli, and it occurred to him that if he were dressed in the costume of the period he would look extravagantly romantic. He remembered his notion of getting him off with a distinguished Frenchwoman and he smiled slyly on reflecting that he was expecting at dinner on Saturday Marie Louise de Florimond, who combined irreproachable connections with notorious immorality. She was forty, but looked ten years younger; she had the delicate beauty of her ancestress painted by Nattier which, owing to Elliott himself, now hung in one of the great American collections; and her sexual voracity was insatiable. Elliott decided to put Larry next to her. He knew she would waste no time in making her desires clear to him. He had already invited a young attaché at the British Embassy whom he thought Isabel might like. Isabel was very pretty, and as he was an Englishman, and well off, it wouldn't matter that she had no fortune. Mellowed by the excellent Montrachet with which they had started lunch and by the fine Bordeaux that followed, Elliott thought with tranquil pleasure of the possibilities that presented themselves to his mind. If things turned out as he thought they very well might, dear Louisa would have no more cause for anxiety. She had always slightly disapproved of him; poor dear, she was very provincial; but he was fond of her. It would be a satisfaction to him to arrange everything for her by help of his knowledge of the world.
        </p>
        <p>To waste no time, Elliott had arranged to take his ladies to look at clothes immediately after lunch, so as they got up from table he intimated to Larry with the tact of which he was a master that he must make himself scarce, but at the same time he asked him with pressing affability to come to the two grand parties he had arranged. He need hardly have taken so much trouble, since Larry accepted both invitations with alacrity.</p>
        <p>But Elliott's plan failed. He was relieved when Larry appeared at the dinner party in a very presentable dinner-jacket, for he had been a little nervous that he would wear the same blue suit that he had worn at lunch; and after dinner, getting Marie Louise de Florimond into a corner, he asked her how she had liked his young American friend. "He has nice eyes and good teeth."</p>
        <p>"Is that all? I put him beside you because I thought he was just your cup of tea."</p>
        <p>She looked at him suspiciously.</p>
        <p>"He told me he was engaged to your pretty niece."</p>
        <p>"Voyons, ma chère, the fact that a man belongs to another woman has never prevented you from taking him away from her if you could."</p>
        <p>"Is that what you want me to do? Well, I'm not going to do your dirty work for you, my poor Elliott."</p>
        <p>Elliott chuckled.</p>
        <p>"The meaning of that, I presume, is that you tried your stuff and found there was nothing doing."</p>
        <p>"Why I like you, Elliott, is that you have the morals of a bawdy-house keeper. You don't want him to marry your niece. Why not? He is well bred and quite charming. But he's really too innocent. I don't think he had the least suspicion of what I meant."</p>
        <p>"You should have been more explicit, dear friend."</p>
        <p>"I have enough experience to know when I'm wasting my time. The fact is that he has eyes only for your little Isabel, and between you and me, she has twenty years advantage over me. And she's sweet."</p>
        <p>"Do you like her dress? I chose it for her myself."</p>
        <p>"It's pretty and it's suitable. But of course she has no chic." Elliott took this as a reflection on himself, and he was not prepared to let Madame de Florimond get away without a dig. He smiled genially.</p>
        <p>"One has to have reached your ripe maturity to have your chic, dear friend," he said,</p>
        <p>Madame de Florimond wielded a bludgeon rather than a rapier. Her retort made Elliott's Virginian blood boil.</p>
        <p>"But I'm sure that in your fair land of gangsters [votre beau pays d'apaches] they will hardly miss something that is so subtle and so inimitable."</p>
        <p>But if Madame de Florimond carped, the rest of Elliott's friends were delighted both with Isabel and with Larry. They liked her fresh prettiness. her abounding health and her vitality; they liked his picturesque appearance, his good manners and his quiet, ironic humour. Both had the advantage of speaking good and fluent French. Mrs. Bradley, after living so many years in diplomatic circles, spoke it correctly enough but with an unabashed American accent. Elliott entertained them lavishly. Isabel, pleased with her new clothes and her new hats, amused by all the gaiety Elliott provided and happy to be with Larry, thought she had never enjoyed herself so much.</p>
        <p>Elliott was of opinion that breakfast was a meal that you should share only with total strangers, and then only if there was no help for it, so Mrs. Bradley, somewhat against her will, and Isabel, far from displeased, were obliged to have theirs in their bedrooms. But Isabel, when she awoke, sometimes told Antoinette the grand maid Elliott had engaged for them, to take her café au lait into her mother's room so that she could talk to her while she had it. In the busy life she led it was the only moment of the day in which she could be alone with her. One such morning, when they had been in Paris nearly a month, after Isabel had done narrating the events of the previous night, most of which she and Larry had spent going the round of the night clubs with a party of friends, Mrs. Bradley let fall the question she had had in mind to ask ever since their arrival.</p>
        <p>"When is he coming back to Chicago?"</p>
        <p>"I don't know. He hasn't spoken of it."</p>
        <p>"Haven't you asked him?"</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"Are you scared to?"</p>
        <p>"No, of course not."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley, lying on a chaise longue, in a modish dressing-gown that Elliott had insisted on giving her, was polishing her nails. "What do you talk about all the time when you're alone?"</p>
        <p>"We don't talk all the time. It's nice to be together. You know, Larry was always rather silent. When we talk I think I do most of the talking."</p>
        <p>"What has he been doing with himself?"</p>
        <p>"I don't really know. I don't think anything very much. I suppose he's been having a good time."</p>
        <p>"And where is he living?"</p>
        <p>"I don't know that either."</p>
        <p>"He seems very reticent, doesn't he?"</p>
        <p>Isabel lit a cigarette and, as she blew a cloud of smoke from her nostrils, looked coolly at her mother.</p>
        <p>"What exactly do you mean by that, Mamma?"</p>
        <p>"Your uncle Elliott thinks he has an apartment and is living there with a woman."</p>
        <p>Isabel burst out laughing.</p>
        <p>"You don't believe that, do you?"</p>
        <p>"No. I honestly don't." Mrs. Bradley looked reflectively at her nails. "Don't you ever talk to him about Chicago?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, a lot."</p>
        <p>"Hasn't he given any sort of indication that he intends to come back?"</p>
        <p>"I can't say he has."</p>
        <p>"He will have been gone two years next October."</p>
        <p>"I know."</p>
        <p>"Well, it's your business, dear, and you must do what you think right. But things don't get any easier by putting them off." She glanced at her daughter, but Isabel would not meet her eyes. Mrs. Bradley gave her an affectionate smile. "If you don't want to be late for lunch you'd better go and have your bath."</p>
        <p>"I'm lunching with Larry. We're going to some place in the Latin Quarter."</p>
        <p>"Enjoy yourself."</p>
        <p>An hour later Larry came to fetch her. They took a cab to the Pont St. Michel and sauntered up the crowded boulevard till they came to a café they liked the look of. They sat down on the terrace and ordered a couple of Dubonnets. Then they took another cab and went to a restaurant. Isabel had a healthy appetite and she enjoyed the good things Larry ordered for her. She enjoyed looking at the people sitting cheek by jowl with them, for the place was packed, and it made her laugh to see the intense pleasure they so obviously took in their food; but she enjoyed above all sitting at a tiny table alone with Larry. She loved the amusement in his eyes while she chattered away gaily. It was enchanting to feel so much at home with him. But at the back of her mind was a vague disquiet, for though he seemed very much at home too, she felt it was not so much with her as with the surroundings. She had been faintly disturbed by what her mother had said, and though seeming to prattle so guilelessly she observed his every expression. He was not quite the same as when he had left Chicago, but she couldn't tell in what the difference lay. He looked exactly as she remembered him, as young, as frank, but his expression was changed. It was not that he was more serious, his face in repose had always been serious, it had a calmness that was new to her; it was as though he had settled something with himself and were at ease in a way he had never been before.
        </p>
        <p>When they had finished lunch he suggested that they should take a stroll through the Luxembourg.</p>
        <p>"No, I don't want to go and look at pictures."</p>
        <p>"All right then, let's go and sit in the gardens."</p>
        <p>"No, I don't want to do that either. I want to go and see where you live."</p>
        <p>"There's nothing to see. I live in a scrubby little room in a hotel."</p>
        <p>"Uncle Elliott says you've got an apartment and are living in sin with an artist's model."</p>
        <p>"Come on then and see for yourself," he laughed. "It's only a step from here. We can walk."</p>
        <p>He took her through narrow, torturous streets, dingy notwithstanding the streak of blue sky that showed between the high houses, and after a while stopped at a small hotel with a pretentious façade.</p>
        <p>"Here we are."</p>
        <p>Isabel followed him into a narrow hall, on one side of which was a desk and behind it a man in shirt-sleeves, with a waistcoat in thin black and yellow stripes and a dirty apron, reading a paper. Larry asked for his key, and the man handed it to him from the rack immediately behind him. He gave Isabel an inquisitive glance that turned into a knowing smirk. It was clear that he thought she was going to Larry's room for no honest purpose.</p>
        <p>They climbed up two flights of stairs, on which was a threadbare red carpet, and Larry unlocked his door. Isabel entered a smallish room with two windows. They looked out on the grey apartment house opposite, on the ground floor of which was a stationer's shop. There was a single bed in the room, with a night table beside it, a heavy wardrobe with a large mirror, an upholstered but straight-backed armchair and a table between the windows on which were a typewriter, papers and a number of books. The chimney-piece was piled with paper-bound volumes.</p>
        <p>"You sit in the armchair. It's not very comfortable but it's the best I can offer."</p>
        <p>He drew up another chair and sat down.</p>
        <p>"Is this where you live?" asked Isabel.</p>
        <p>He chuckled at the look on her face.</p>
        <p>"It is. I've been here ever since I came to Paris."</p>
        <p>"But why?"</p>
        <p>"It's convenient. It's near the Bibliothèque Nationale and the Sorbonne." He pointed to a door she had not noticed. "It's got a bathroom. I can get breakfast here and I generally dine at that restaurant where we had lunch."</p>
        <p>"It's awfully sordid."</p>
        <p>"Oh no, it's all right. It's all I want."</p>
        <p>"But what sort of people live here?"</p>
        <p>"Oh, I don't know. Up in the attics a few students. Two or three old bachelors in government offices and a retired actress at the Odéon; the only other room with a bath is occupied by a kept woman whose gentleman friend comes to see her every other Thursday; I suppose a few transients. It's a very quiet and respectable place."</p>
        <p>Isabel was a trifle disconcerted and because she knew Larry noticed it and was amused she was half inclined to take offence.</p>
        <p>"What's that great big book on the table?" she asked.</p>
        <p>"That? Oh, that's my Greek dictionary."</p>
        <p>"Your what?" she cried,</p>
        <p>"It's all right. It won't bite you."</p>
        <p>"Are you learning Greek?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>"I thought I’d like to."</p>
        <p>He was looking at her with a smile in his eyes and she smiled back at him.</p>
        <p>"Don't you think you might tell me what you've been up to all the time you've been in Paris?"</p>
        <p>"I've been reading a good deal. Eight or ten hours a day. I've attended lectures at the Sorbonne. I think I've read everything that's important in French literature and I can read Latin, at least Latin prose, almost as easily as I can read French. Of course Greek's more difficult. But I have a very good teacher. Until you came here I used to go to him three evenings a week."</p>
        <p>"And what is that going to lead to?"</p>
        <p>"The acquisition of knowledge," he smiled.</p>
        <p>"It doesn't sound very practical."</p>
        <p>"Perhaps it isn't and on the other hand perhaps it is. But it's enormous fun. You can't imagine what a thrill it is to read the Odyssey in the original. It makes you feel as if you only had to get on tiptoe and stretch out your hands to touch the stars."</p>
        <p>He got up from his chair, as though impelled by an excitement that seized him, and walked up and down the small room.</p>
        <p>"I've been reading Spinoza the last month or two. I don't suppose I understand very much of it yet, but it fills me with exultation. It's like landing from your plane on a great plateau in the mountains. Solitude, and an air so pure that it goes to your head like wine and you feel like a million dollars."</p>
        <p>"When are you coming back to Chicago?"</p>
        <p>"Chicago? I don't know. I haven't thought of it."</p>
        <p>"You said that if you hadn't got what you wanted after two years you'd give it up as a bad job."</p>
        <p>"I couldn't go back now. I'm on the threshold. I see vast lands of the spirit stretching out before me, beckoning, and I'm eager to travel them."</p>
        <p>"What do you expect to find in them?"</p>
        <p>"The answers to my questions." He gave her a glance that was almost playful, so that except that she knew him so well, she might have thought he was speaking in jest. "I want to make up my mind whether God is or God is not. I want to find out why evil exists. I want to know whether I have an immortal soul or whether when I die it's the end."</p>
        <p>Isabel gave a little gasp. It made her uncomfortable to hear Larry say such things, and she was thankful that he spoke so lightly, in the tone of ordinary conversation, that it was possible for her to overcome her embarrassment.</p>
        <p>"But Larry," she smiled. "People have been asking those questions for thousands of years. If they could be answered, surely they'd have been answered by now."</p>
        <p>Larry chuckled.</p>
        <p>"Don't laugh as if I'd said something idiotic," she said sharply.</p>
        <p>"On the contrary I think you've said something shrewd. But on the other hand you might say that if men have been asking them for thousands of years it proves that they can't help asking them and have to go on asking them. Besides, it's not true that no one has found the answers. There are more answers than questions, and lots of people have found answers that were perfectly satisfactory for them. Old Ruysbroek for instance."</p>
        <p>"Who was he?"</p>
        <p>"Oh, just a guy I didn't know at college," Larry answered flippantly.</p>
        <p>Isabel didn't know what he meant, but passed on.</p>
        <p>"It all sounds so adolescent to me. Those are the sort of things sophomores get excited about and then when they leave college they forget about them. They have to earn a living."</p>
        <p>"I don't blame them. You see, I'm in the happy position that I have enough to live on. If I hadn't I'd have had to do like everybody else and make money."</p>
        <p>"But doesn't money mean anything to you?"</p>
        <p>"Not a thing," he grinned.</p>
        <p>"How long d'you think all this is going to take you?"</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't know. Five years. Ten years."</p>
        <p>"And after that? What are you going to do with all this wisdom?"</p>
        <p>"If I ever acquire wisdom I suppose I shall be wise enough to know what to do with it."</p>
        <p>Isabel clasped her hands passionately and leant forwards in her chair.</p>
        <p>"You're so wrong, Larry. You're an American. Your place isn't here. Your place is in America."</p>
        <p>"I shall come back when I'm ready."</p>
        <p>"But you're missing so much. How can you bear to sit here in a backwater just when we're living through the most wonderful adventure the world has ever known? Europe's finished. We're the greatest, the most powerful people in the world. We're going forward by leaps and bounds. We've got everything. It's your duty to take part in the development of your country. You've forgotten, you don't know how thrilling life is in America today. Are you sure you're not doing this because you haven't the courage to stand up to the work that's before every American now? Oh, I know you're working in a way, but isn't it just an escape from your responsibilities? Is it more than just a sort of laborious idleness? What would happen to America if everyone shirked as you're shirking?"</p>
        <p>"You're very severe, honey," he smiled. "The answer to that is that everyone doesn't feel like me. Fortunately for themselves, perhaps, most people are prepared to follow the normal course; what you forget is that I want to learn as passionately as—Gray, for instance, wants to make pots of money. Am I really a traitor to my country because I want to spend a few years educating myself? It may be that when I'm through I shall have something to give that people will be glad to take. It's only a chance, of course, but if I fail I shall be no worse off than a man who's gone into business and hasn't made a go of it."</p>
        <p>"And what about me? Am I of no importance to you at all?"</p>
        <p>"You're of very great importance. I want you to marry me."</p>
        <p>"When? In ten years?"</p>
        <p>"No. Now. As soon as possible."</p>
        <p>"On what? Mamma can't afford to give me anything. Besides, she wouldn't if she could. She'd think it wrong to help you to live without doing anything."</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't want to take anything from your mother," said Larry. "I've got three thousand a year. That's plenty in Paris. We could have a little apartment and a bonne à tout faire. We'd have such a lark, darling."</p>
        <p>"But, Larry, one can't live on three thousand a year."</p>
        <p>"Of course one can. Lots of people live on much less."</p>
        <p>"But I don't want to live on three thousand a year. There's no reason why I should."</p>
        <p>"I've been living on half that."</p>
        <p>"But how!"</p>
        <p>She looked at the dingy little room with a shudder of distaste.</p>
        <p>"It means I've got a bit saved up. We could go down to Capri for our honeymoon and then in the fall we'd go to Greece. I'm crazy to go there. Don't you remember how we used to talk about travelling all over the world together?"</p>
        <p>"Of course I want to travel. But not like that. I don't want to travel second-class on steamships and put up at third-rate hotels, without a bathroom, and eat at cheap restaurants."</p>
        <p>"I went all through Italy last October like that. I had a wonderful time. We could travel all over the world on three thousand a year."</p>
        <p>"But I want to have babies, Larry."</p>
        <p>"That's all right. We'll take them along with us."</p>
        <p>"You're so silly," she laughed. "D'you know what it costs to have a baby? Violet Tomlinson had one last year and she did it as cheaply as she could and it cost her twelve hundred and fifty. And what d'you think a nurse costs?" She grew more vehement as one idea after another occurred to her. "You're so impractical. You don't know what you're asking me to do. I'm young, I want to have fun. I want to do all the things that people do. I want to go to parties, I want to go to dances, I want to play golf and ride horseback. I want to wear nice clothes. Can't you imagine what it means to a girl not to be as well dressed as the rest of her crowd? D'you know what it means, Larry, to buy your friends' old dresses when they're sick of them and be thankful when someone out of pity makes you a present of a new one? I couldn't even afford to go to a decent hairdresser to have my hair properly done. I don't want to go about in street-cars and omnibuses; I want to have my own car. And what d'you suppose I'd find to do with myself all day long while you were reading at the Library? Walk about the streets window-shopping or sit in the Luxembourg Garden seeing that my children didn't get into mischief? We wouldn't have any friends."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, Isabel," he interrupted.</p>
        <p>"Not the sort of friends I'm used to. Oh yes, Uncle Elliott's friends would ask us now and then for his sake, but we couldn't go because I wouldn't have the clothes to go in, and we wouldn't go because we couldn't afford to return their hospitality. I don't want to know a lot of scrubby, unwashed people; I've got nothing to say to them and they've got nothing to say to me. I want to live, Larry." She grew suddenly conscious of the look in his eyes, tender as it always was when fixed on her, but gently amused. "You think I'm silly, don't you? You think I'm being trivial and horrid."</p>
        <p>"No, I don't. I think what you say is very natural."</p>
        <p>He was standing with his back to the fireplace, and she got up and went up to him so that they were face to face. "Larry, if you hadn't a cent to your name and got a job that brought you in three thousand a year I'd marry you without a minute's hesitation. I'd cook for you, I'd make the beds, I wouldn't care what I wore, I'd go without anything, I'd look upon it as wonderful fun, because I'd know that it was only a question of time and you'd make good. But this means living in a sordid beastly way all our lives with nothing to look forward to. It means that I should be a drudge to the day of my death. And for what? So that you can spend years trying to find answers to questions that you say yourself are insoluble. It's so wrong. A man ought to work. That's what he's here for. That's how he contributes to the welfare of the community."</p>
        <p>"In short it's his duty to settle down in Chicago and enter Henry Maturin's business. Do you think that by getting my friends to buy the securities that Henry Maturin is interested in I should add greatly to the welfare of the community?"</p>
        <p>"There must be brokers and it's a perfectly decent and honourable way of earning a living."</p>
        <p>"You've drawn a very black picture of life in Paris on a moderate income. You know, it isn't really like that. One can dress very nicely without going to Chanel. And all the interesting people don't live in the neighbourhood of the Arc de Triomphe and the Avenue Foch. In fact few interesting people do, because interesting people generally don't have a lot of money. I know quite a number of people here, painters and writers and students, French, English, American, and what not, whom I think you'd find much more amusing than Elliott's seedy marquises and long-nosed duchesses. You've got a quick mind and a lively sense of humour. You'd enjoy hearing them swap ideas across the dinner table even though the wine was only vin ordinaire and you didn't have a butler and a couple of footmen to wait on you."</p>
        <p>"Don't be stupid, Larry. Of course I would. You know I'm not a snob. I'd love to meet interesting people."</p>
        <p>"Yes, in a Chanel dress. D'you think they wouldn't catch on to it that you looked upon it as a sort of cultured slumming? They wouldn't be at their ease, any more than you would, and you wouldn't get anything out of it except to tell Emily de Montadour and Gracie de Chateau-Gaillard afterwards what fun you'd had meeting a lot of weird bohemians in the Latin Quarter."</p>
        <p>Isabel slightly shrugged her shoulders.</p>
        <p>"I dare say you're right. They're not the sort of people I've been brought up with. They're not the sort of people I have anything in common with."</p>
        <p>"Where does that leave us?"</p>
        <p>"Just where we started. I've lived in Chicago ever since I can remember. All my friends are there. All my interests are there. I'm at home there. It's where I belong and it's where you belong. Mamma's ill and she's never going to get any better. I couldn't leave her even if I wanted to."</p>
        <p>"Does that mean that unless I'm prepared to come back to Chicago you don't want to marry me?"</p>
        <p>Isabel hesitated. She loved Larry. She wanted to marry him. She wanted him with all the power of her senses. She knew that he desired her. She couldn't believe that when it came to a showdown he wouldn't weaken. She was afraid, but she had to risk it.</p>
        <p>"Yes, Larry, that's just what it does mean."</p>
        <p>He struck a match on the chimney-piece, one of those old-fashioned French sulphur matches that fill your nostrils with an acrid odour, and lit his pipe. Then, passing her, he went over and stood by one of the windows. He looked out. He was silent for what seemed an endless time. She stood as she had stood before, when she was facing him, and looked in the mirror over the chimney-piece, but she did not see herself. Her heart was beating madly and she was sick with apprehension. He turned at last. "I wish I could make you see how much fuller the life I offer you is than anything you have a conception of. I wish I could make you see how exciting the life of the spirit is and how rich in experience. It's illimitable. It's such a happy life. There's only one thing like it, when you're up in a plane by yourself, high, high, and only infinity surrounds you. You're intoxicated by the boundless space. You feel such a sense of exhilaration that you wouldn't exchange it for all the power and glory in the world. I was reading Descartes the other day. The ease, the grace, the lucidity. Gosh!"
        </p>
        <p>"But Larry," she interrupted him desperately, "don't you see you're asking something of me that I'm not fitted for, that I'm not interested in and don't want to be interested in? How often have I got to repeat to you that I'm just an ordinary, normal girl, I'm twenty, in ten years I shall be old, I want to have a good time while I have the chance. Oh, Larry, I do love you so terribly. All this is just trifling. It's not going to lead you anywhere. For your own sake I beseech you to give it up. Be a man, Larry, and do a man's work. You're just wasting the precious years that others are doing so much with. Larry, if you love me you won't give me up for a dream. You've had your fling. Come back with us to America."</p>
        <p>"I can't, darling. It would be death to me. It would be the betrayal of my soul."</p>
        <p>"Oh, Larry, why d'you talk in that way? That's the way hysterical, highbrow women talk. What does it mean? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing."</p>
        <p>"It happens to mean exactly what I feel," he answered, his eyes twinkling.</p>
        <p>"How can you laugh? Don't you realize this is desperately serious? We've come to the cross-roads and what we do now is going to affect our whole lives."</p>
        <p>"I know that. Believe me, I'm perfectly serious."</p>
        <p>She sighed.</p>
        <p>"If you won't listen to reason there's nothing more to be said."</p>
        <p>"But I don't think it's reason. I think you've been talking the most terrible nonsense all the time."</p>
        <p>"I?" If she hadn't been so miserable she would have laughed. "My poor Larry, you're as crazy as a coot."</p>
        <p>She slowly slipped her engagement ring off her finger. She placed it on the palm of her hand and looked at it. It was a square-cut ruby set in a thin platinum band and she had always liked it.</p>
        <p>"If you loved me you wouldn't make me so unhappy."</p>
        <p>"I do love you. Unfortunately sometimes one can't do what one thinks is right without making someone else unhappy." She stretched out her hand on which the ruby was resting and forced a smile to her trembling lips.</p>
        <p>"Here you are, Larry."</p>
        <p>"It's no good to me. Won't you keep it as a memento of our friendship? You can wear it on your little finger. Our friendship needn't stop, need it?"</p>
        <p>"I shall always care for you, Larry."</p>
        <p>"Then keep it. I should like you to."</p>
        <p>She hesitated for an instant, then put it on the finger of her right hand.</p>
        <p>"It's too large."</p>
        <p>"You can have it altered. Let's go to the Ritz bar and have a drink."</p>
        <p>"All right."</p>
        <p>She was a trifle taken aback that it had all gone so easily. She had not cried. Nothing seemed to be changed except that now she wasn't going to marry Larry. She could hardly believe that everythmg was over and done with. She resented a little the fact that they hadn't had a terrific scene. They had talked it all over almost as coolly as though they had been discussing the taking of a house. She felt let down, but at the same time was conscious of a slight sense of satisfaction because they had behaved in such a civilized way. She would have given a lot to know exactly what Larry was feeling. But it was always difficult to know that; his smooth face, his dark eyes were a mask that she was aware even she, who had known him for so many years, could not penetrate. She had taken off her hat and laid it on the bed. Now, standing before the mirror, she put it on again.</p>
        <p>"Just as a matter of interest," she said, arranging her hair, "did you want to break our engagement?"</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"I thought it might be a relief to you." He made no reply. She turned round with a gay smile on her lips. "Now I'm ready."</p>
        <p>Larry locked the door behind him. When he handed the key to the man at the desk he enveloped them both in a look of conniving archness. It was impossible for Isabel not to guess what he thought they had been up to.</p>
        <p>"I don't believe that old fellow would bet much on my virginity," she said.</p>
        <p>They took a taxi to the Ritz and had a drink. They spoke of indifferent things, without apparent constraint, like two old friends who saw one another every day. Though Larry was naturally silent, Isabel was a talkative girl, with an ample fund of chit-chat, and she was determined that no silence should fall between them that might be hard to break. She wasn't going to let Larry think she felt any resentment towards him and her pride constrained her to act so that he should not suspect that she was hurt and unhappy. Presently she suggested that he should drive her home. When he dropped her at the door she said to him gaily:</p>
        <p>"Don't forget that you're lunching with us tomorrow."</p>
        <p>"You bet your life I won't."</p>
        <p>She gave him her cheek to kiss and passed through the porte cochere.</p>

        <p><i>(v)</i></p>
        <p>When Isabel entered the drawing-room she found that some people had dropped in to tea. There were two American women who lived in Paris, exquisitely gowned, with strings of pearls round their necks, diamond bracelets on their wrists and costly rings on their fingers. Though the hair of one was darkly hennaed and that of the other unnaturally golden they were strangely alike. They had the same heavily mascaraed eyelashes, the same brightly painted lips, the same rouged cheeks, the same slim figures, maintained at the cost of extreme mortification, the same clear, harp features, the same hungry restless eyes; and you could not but be conscious that their lives were a desperate struggle to maintain their fading charms. They talked with inanity in a loud, metallic voice without a moment's pause, as though afraid that if they were silent for an instant the machine would run down and the artificial construction which was all they were would fall to pieces. There was also a secretary from the American Embassy, suave, silent, for he could not get a word in, and very much the man of the world, and a small dark Rumanian prince, all bows and servility, with little darting black eyes and a clean-shaven swarthy face, who was for ever jumping up to hand a teacup, pass a plate of cakes, or light a cigarette, and who shamelessly dished out to those present the most flattering, the most gross compliments. He was paying for all the dinners he had received from the objects of his adulation and for all the dinners he hoped to receive.
        </p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley, seated at the tea table and dressed to please Elliott somewhat more grandly than she thought suitable to the occasion, performed her duties as hostess with her usual civil but rather indifferent composure. What she thought of her brother's guests I can only imagine. I never knew her more than slightly and she was a woman who kept herself to herself. She was not a stupid woman; in all the years she had lived in foreign capitals she had met innumerable people of all kinds and I think she summed them up shrewdly enough according to the standards of the small Virginian town where she was bom and bred. I think she got a certain amount of amusement from observing their antics and I don't believe she took their airs and graces any more seriously than she took the aches and pains of the characters in a novel which she knew from the beginning (otherwise she wouldn't have read it) would end happily. Paris, Rome, Peking had had no more effect on her Americanism than Elliott's devout Catholicism on her robust, but not inconvenient, Presbyterian faith.
        </p>
        <p>Isabel, with her youth, her strapping good looks and her vitality brought a breath of fresh air into that meretricious atmosphere. She swept in like a young earth goddess. The Rumanian prince leapt to his feet to draw forward a chair for her and with ample gesticulation did his shift. The two American ladies, with shrill amiabilities on their lips, looked her up and down, took in the details of her dress and perhaps in their hearts felt a pang of dismay at being confronted with her exuberant youth. The American diplomat smiled to himself as he saw how false and haggard she made them look. But Isabel thought they were grand; she liked their rich clothes and expensive pearls and felt a twinge of envy for their sophisticated poise. She wondered if she would ever achieve that supreme elegance. Of course the little Rumanian was quite ridiculous, but he was rather sweet and even if he didn't mean the charming things he said it was nice to listen to them. The conversation which her entrance had interrupted was resumed and they talked so brightly, with so much conviction that what they were saying was worth saying, that you almost thought they were talking sense. They talked of the parties they had been to and the parties they were going to. They gossiped about the latest scandal. They tore their friends to pieces. They bandied great names from one to the other. They seemed to know everybody. They were in on all the secrets. Almost in a breath they touched upon the latest play, the latest dressmaker, the latest portrait painter, and the latest mistress of the latest premier. One would have thought there was nothing they didn't know. Isabel listened with ravishment. It all seemed to her wonderfully civilized. This really was life. It gave her a thrilling sense of being in the midst of things. This was real. The setting was perfect. That spacious room with the Savonneric carpet on the floor, the lovely drawings on the richly-panelled walls, the petit-point chairs on which they sat, the priceless pieces of marquetry, commodes and occasional tables, every piece worthy to go into a museum; it must have cost a fortune, that room, but it was worth it. Its beauty, its discretion struck her as never before because she had still so vividly in her mind the shabby little hotel room, with its iron bed and that hard, comfortless chair in which he had sat, that room that Larry saw nothing wrong in. It was bare, cheerless and horrid. It made her shudder to remember it.
        </p>
        <p>The party broke up and Isabel was left with her mother and Elliott.</p>
        <p>"Charming women," said Elliott when he came back from seeing the two poor painted drabs to the door. "I knew them when they first settled in Paris. I never dreamt they'd turn out as well as they have. It's amazing, the adaptability of our women. You'd hardly know now they were Americans and Middle West into the bargain."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley, raising her eyebrows, without speaking gave him a look which he was too quick-witted not to understand.</p>
        <p>"No one could ever say that of you, my poor Louisa," he continued half acidly and half affectionately. "Though heaven knows, you've had every chance."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley pursed her lips.</p>
        <p>"I'm afraid I've been a sad disappointment to you, Elliott, but to tell you the truth I'm very satisfied with myself as I am."</p>
        <p>"Tous les goûts sont dans la nature," Elliott murmured.</p>
        <p>"I think I ought to tell you that I'm no longer engaged to Larry," said Isabel.</p>
        <p>"Tut," cried Elliott. "That'll put my luncheon table out for tomorrow. How on earth am I going to get another man at this short notice?"</p>
        <p>"Oh, he's coming to lunch all right."</p>
        <p>"After you've broken off your engagement? That sounds very unconventional."</p>
        <p>Isabel giggled. She kept her gaze on Elliott, for she knew her mother's eyes were fixed upon her and she didn't want to meet them.</p>
        <p>"We haven't quarreled. We talked it over this afternoon and came to the conclusion we'd made a mistake. He doesn't want to come back to America; he wants to stop on in Paris. He's talking of going to Greece."</p>
        <p>"What on earth for? There's no society in Athens. As a matter of fact I never thought so much of Greek art myself. Some of that Hellenistic stuff has a certain decadent charm that's rather attractive. But Phidias: no, no."</p>
        <p>"Look at me, Isabel," said Mrs. Bradley.</p>
        <p>Isabel turned and with a faint smile on her lips faced her mother. Mrs. Bradley gave her a scrutinizing stare, but all she said was, "H'm." The girl hadn't been crying, that she saw; she looked calm and composed.</p>
        <p>"I think you're well out of it, Isabel," said Elliott. "I was prepared to make the best of it, but I never thought it a good match. He wasn't really up to your mark, and the way he's been behaving in Paris is a pretty clear indication that he'll never amount to anything. With your looks and your connections you can aspire to something better than that. I think you've behaved in a very sensible manner."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley gave her daughter a glance that was not devoid of anxiety.</p>
        <p>"You haven't done this on my account, Isabel?"</p>
        <p> Isabel shook her head decidedly. "No, darling, I've done it entirely on my own."</p>

        <p><i>(vi)</i></p>
        <p>I had come back from the East and was spending some time in London just then. It was perhaps a fortnight after the events I have just related that Elliott called me up one morning. I was not surprised to hear his voice, for I knew that he was in the habit of coming to England to enjoy the fag end of the season. He told me that Mrs. Bradley and Isabel were with him and if I would drop in that evening at six for a drink they would be glad to see me. They were, of course, staying at Claridge's. I was at that time living not far from there, so I strolled down Park Lane and through the quiet, dignified streets of Mayfair till I came to the hotel. Elliott had his usual suite. It was panelled in brown wood like the wood of a cigar box and furnished with quiet sumptuousness. He was alone when I was ushered in. Mrs. Bradley and Isabel had gone shopping and he was expecting them at any minute. He told me that Isabel had broken her engagement to Larry.</p>
        <p>Elliott with his romantic and highly conventional sense of how people should comport themselves under given circumstances had been disconcerted by the young people's behaviour. Not only had Larry come to lunch the very day after the break, but he had acted as though his position were unchanged. He was as pleasant, attentive and soberly gay as usual. He treated Isabel with the same comradely affectionateness with which he had always treated her. He seemed neither harassed, upset nor woe-begone. Nor did Isabel appear dispirited. She looked as happy, she laughed as lightly, she jested as merrily as though she had not just taken a decisive and surely searing step in her life. Elliott could not make head or tail of it. From such scraps of their conversation as he caught he gathered that they had no intention of breaking any of the dates they had made. On the first opportunity he talked it over with his sister.</p>
        <p>"It's not decent," he said. "They can't run around together as if they were still engaged. Larry really should have more sense of propriety. Besides, it damages Isabel's chances. Young Fotheringham, that boy at the British Embassy, is obviously taken with her; he's got money and he's very well connected; if he knew the coast was clear I wouldn't be at all surprised if he made her an offer, I think you ought to talk to her about it."</p>
        <p>"My dear, Isabel's twenty and she has a technique for telling you to mind your own business without offensiveness which I've always found very difficult to cope with."</p>
        <p>"Then you've brought her up extremely badly, Louisa. And besides, it <i>is</i> your business."</p>
        <p>"That is a point on which you and she would certainly differ."</p>
        <p>"You're trying my patience, Louisa."</p>
        <p>"My poor Elliott, if you'd ever had a grown-up daughter you'd know that by comparison a bucking steer is easy to manage. And as to knowing what goes on inside her—well, it's much better to pretend you're the simple, innocent old fool she almost certainly takes you for."</p>
        <p>"But you have talked the matter over with her?"</p>
        <p>"I tried to. She laughed at me and told me there was really nothing to tell."</p>
        <p>"Is she cut up?"</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't know. All I do know is that she eats well and sleeps like a child."</p>
        <p>"Well, take my word for it, if you let them go on like this they'll go off one of these days and get married without saying a word to anybody."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley permitted herself to smile.</p>
        <p>"It must be a relief to you to think that at present we're living in a country where every facility is afforded to sexual irregularity and every obstacle put in the way of marriage."</p>
        <p>"And quite rightly. Marriage is a serious matter on which rest the security of the family and the stability of the state. But marriage can only maintain its authority if extraconjugal relations are not only tolerated but sanctioned. Prostitution, my poor Louisa——"</p>
        <p>"That'll do, Elliott,' interrupted Mrs. Bradley. "I'm not interested in your views on the social and moral values of promiscuous fornication."</p>
        <p>It was then he put forward a scheme that would interrupt Isabel's continued intercourse with Larry, which was so repugnant to his sense of what was fitting. The Paris season was drawing to a close and all the best people were arranging to go to watering places or to Deauville before repairing for the rest or the summer to their ancestral chateaus in Touraine, Anjou or Brittany, Ordinarily Elliott went to London at the end of June, but his family feeling was strong and his affection for his sister and Isabel sincere; he had been quite ready to sacrifice himself and remain in Paris, if they wished it, when no one who was anyone was there; but he found himself now in the agreeable situation of being able to do what was best for others and at the same time what was convenient to himself. He proposed to Mrs. Bradley that the three of them should go to London immediately, where the season was still in full swing and where new interests and new friends would distract Isabel's mind from her unfortunate entanglement. According to the papers the great specialist on Mrs. Bradley's disease was then in the British capital and the desirability of consulting him would reasonably account for their precipitate departure and override any disinclination to leave Paris that Isabel might have. Mrs. Bradley fell in with the plan. She was puzzled by Isabel. She could not make up her mind whether she was as carefree as she seemed or whether, hurt, angry or heartsick, she was putting on a bold front to conceal her wounded feelings. Mrs. Bradley could only agree with Elliott that it would do Isabel good to see new people and new places.
        </p>
        <p>Elliott got busy on the telephone and when Isabel, who had been spending the day at Versailles with Larry, came home, he was able to tell her that he had made an appointment for her mother to see the celebrated doctor three days from then, that he had engaged a suite at Claridge's and that they were starting on the next day but one. Mrs. Bradley watched her daughter while this intelligence was being somewhat smugly imparted to her by Elliott, but she did not turn a hair.</p>
        <p> "Oh, darling, I'm so glad you're going to see that doctor," she cried with her usual rather breathless impetuosity. "Of course, you mustn't miss the chance. And it'll be grand going to London. How long are we going to stay?"</p>
        <p>"It would be useless to come back to Paris," said Elliott. "There won't be a soul here in a week. I want you to stay with me at Claridge's for the rest of the season. There are always some good balls in July and of course there's Wimbledon. And then Goodwood and Cowes. I'm sure the Ellinghams will be glad to have us on their yacht for Cowes and the Bantocks always have a large party for Goodwood."</p>
        <p>Isabel appeared to be delighted and Mrs. Bradley was reassured. It looked as though she were not giving Larry a thought.</p>
        <p>Elliott had just finished telling me all this when mother and daughter came in. I had not seen them for more than eighteen months. Mrs. Bradley was a little thinner than before and more pasty-faced; she looked tired and none too well. But Isabel was blooming. With her high colour, the rich brown of her hair, her snining hazel eyes, her clear skin, she gave an impression of such youth, of so much enjoyment of the mere fact of being alive, that you felt half inclined to laugh with delight. She gave me the rather absurd notion of a pear, golden and luscious, perfectly ripe and simply asking to be eaten. She radiated warmth so that you thought that if you held out your hands you could feel its comfort. She looked taller than when I had last seen her, whether because she wore higher heels or because the clever dressmaker had cut her frock to conceal her youthful plumpness I don't know, and she held herself with the graceful ease of a girl who has played outdoor games since childhood. She was in short sexually a very attractive young woman. Had I been her mother I should have thought it high time she was married.
        </p>
        <p>Glad of the opportunity to repay some of the kindness I had received from Mrs. Bradley in Chicago, I asked them all three to come to a play with me one evening. I arranged to give a luncheon for them.</p>
        <p> "You'll be wise to get in at once, my dear fellow," said Elliott. "I've already let my friends know we're here and I presume that in a day or two we shall be fixed up for the rest of the season."</p>
        <p>I understood by this that Elliott meant that then they would have no time for the likes of me and I laughed. Elliott gave me a glance in which I discerned a certain hauteur.</p>
        <p>"But of course you'll generally find us here about six o'clock and we shall always be glad to see you," he said graciously, but with the evident intention of putting me, as an author, in my humble place.</p>
        <p>But the worm sometimes turns.</p>
        <p>"You must try to get in touch with the St. Olpherds," I said. "I hear they want to dispose of their Constable of Salisbury Cathedral."</p>
        <p>"I'm not buying any pictures just now."</p>
        <p>"I know, but I thought you might dispose of it for them."</p>
        <p>A steely gutter came into Elliott's eyes.</p>
        <p>"My dear fellow, the English are a great people, but they have never been able to paint and never will be able to paint. I am not interested in the English school."</p>

        <p><i>(vii)</i></p>
        <p>During the next four weeks I saw little of Elliott and his relations. He did them proud. He took them for a weekend to a grand house in Sussex and for another weekend to an even grander one in Wiltshire. He took them to the royal box at the opera as guests of a minor princess of the House of Windsor. He took them to lunch and dine with the great. Isabel went to several balls. He entertained at Claridge's a series of guests whose names made a fine show in the paper next day. He gave supper parties at Giro's and the Embassy. In fact he did all the right things and Isabel would have had to be much more sophisticated than she was not to have been a trifle dazzled by the splendour and elegance he provided for her delectation. Elliott could flatter himself that he was taking all this trouble from the purely unselfish motive of distracting Isabel's mind from an unfortunate love affair; but I had a notion he got besides a good deal of satisfaction out of letting his sister see with her own eyes how familiar he was with the illustrious and fashionable. He was an admirable host and he took a delight in displaying his virtuosity.
        </p>
        <p>I went to one or two of his parties myself and now and again I dropped in at Claridge's at six o'clock. I found Isabel surrounded by strapping young men in beautiful clothes who were in the Household Brigade or by elegant young men in less beautiful clothes from the Foreign Office. It was on one of these occasions that she drew me aside.</p>
        <p>"I want to ask you something," she said. "Do you remember that evening we went to a drugstore and had an ice-cream soda?"</p>
        <p>"Perfectly."</p>
        <p>"You were very nice and helpful then. Will you be nice and helpful again?"</p>
        <p>"I'll do my best."</p>
        <p>"I want to talk to you about something. Couldn't we lunch one day?"</p>
        <p>"Almost any day you like."</p>
        <p>"Somewhere quiet."</p>
        <p>"What d'you say to driving down to Hampton Court and lunching there? The gardens should be at their best just now and you could see Queen Elizabeth's bed."</p>
        <p>The notion suited her and we fixed a day. But when the day came the weather, which had been fine and warm, broke; the sky was grey and a drizzling rain was falling. I called up and asked her if she wouldn't prefer to lunch in town.</p>
        <p>"We shouldn't be able to sit in the gardens and the pictures will be so dark, we shan't see a thing."</p>
        <p>"I’ve sat in lots of gardens and I'm fed to the teeth with old masters. Let's go anyway."</p>
        <p>"All right."</p>
        <p>I fetched her and we drove down. I knew a small hotel where one ate tolerably and we went straight there. On the way Isabel talked with her usual vivacity of the parties she had been to and the people she had met. She had been enjoying herself, but her comments on the various acquaintances she had made suggested to me that she had shrewdness and a quick eye for the absurd. The bad weather kept visitors away and we were the only occupants of the dining-room. The hotel specialized in homely English fare and we had a cut off of a leg of excellent lamb with green peas and new potatoes and a deep-dish apple pie with Devonshire cream to follow. With a tankard of pale ale it made an excellent lunch, When we had finished I suggested that we should go into the empty coffee-room where there were armchairs in which we could sit in comfort. It was chilly in there, but the fire was laid, so I put a match to it. The flames made the dingy room more companionable.</p>
        <p>"That's that," I said. "Now tell me what you want to talk to me about."</p>
        <p>"It's the same as last time," she chuckled. "Larry."</p>
        <p>"So I guessed."</p>
        <p>"You know that we've broken off our engagement."</p>
        <p>"Elliott told me."</p>
        <p>"Mamma's relieved and he's delighted."</p>
        <p>She hesitated for a moment and then embarked upon the account of her talk with Larry of which I have done my best faithfully to inform the reader. It may surprise the reader that she should have chosen to tell so much to someone whom she knew so little. I don't suppose I had seen her a dozen times and, except for that one occasion at the drugstore, never alone. It did not surprise me. For one thing, as any writer will tell you, people do tell a writer things that they don't tell others. I don't know why, unless it is that having read one or two of his books they feel on peculiarly intimate terms with him; or it may be that they dramatize themselves and, seeing themselves as it were as characters in a novel, are ready to be as open with him as they imagine the characters of his invention are. And I think that Isabel felt that I liked Larry and her, and that their youth touched me, and that I was sympathetic to their distresses. She could not expect to find a friendly listener in Elliott who was disinclined to trouble himself with a young man who had spurned the best chance a young man ever had of getting into society. Nor could her mother help her. Mrs. Bradley had high principles and common sense. Her common sense assured her that if you wanted to get on in this world you must accept its conventions, and not to do what everybody else did clearly pointed to instability. Her high principles led her to believe that a man's duty was to go to work in a business where by energy and initiative he had a chance of earning enough money to keep his wife and family in accordance with the standards of his station, give his sons such an education as would enable them on reaching man's estate to make an honest living, and on his death leave his widow adequately provided for.
        </p>
        <p>Isabel had a good memory and the various turns of the long discussion had engraved themselves upon it. I listened in silence till she had finished. She only interrupted herself once to ask me a question.</p>
        <p>"Who was Ruysdael?"</p>
        <p>"Ruysdael? He was a Dutch landscape painter. Why?"</p>
        <p>She told me that Larry had mentioned him. He had said that Ruysdael at least had found an answer to the questions he was asking, and she repeated to me his flippant reply when she had enquired who he was.</p>
        <p>"What d'you suppose he meant?"</p>
        <p>I had an inspiration.</p>
        <p>"Are you sure he didn't say Ruysbroek?"</p>
        <p>"He might have. Who was he?"</p>
        <p>"He was a Flemish mystic who lived in the fourteenth century."</p>
        <p>"Oh," she said with disappointment.</p>
        <p>It meant nothing to her. But it meant something to me. That was the first indication I had of the turn Larry's reflection was taking, and while she went on with her story, though still listening attentively, part of my mind busied itself with the possibilities that reference of his had suggested. I did not want to make too much of it, for it might be that he had only mentioned the name of the Ecstatic Teacher to make an argumentative point; it might also have a significance that had escaped Isabel. When he answered her question by saying Ruysbroek was just a guy he hadn't known in college he evidently meant to throw her off the scent.</p>
        <p>"What do you make of it all?" she asked when she had come to an end.</p>
        <p>I paused before replying.</p>
        <p>"D'you remember his saying that he was just going to loaf? If what he tells you is true his loafing seems to involve some very strenuous work."</p>
        <p>"I'm sure it's true. But don't you see that if he'd worked as hard at any productive form of work he'd be earning a decent income?"</p>
        <p>"There are people who are strangely constituted. There are criminals who'll work like beavers to contrive schemes that land them in prison and they no sooner get out than they start all over again and again land in prison. If they put as much industry, as much cleverness, resource and patience into honest practices they could make a handsome living and occupy important positions. But they're just made that way. They like crime."</p>
        <p>"Poor Larry," she giggled. "You're not going to suggest that he's learning Greek to cook up a bank robbery?"</p>
        <p>I laughed too.</p>
        <p>"No, I'm not. What I'm trying to tell you is that there are men who are possessed by an urge so strong to do some particular thing that they can't help themselves, they've got to do it. They're prepared to sacrifice everything to satisfy their yearning."</p>
        <p>"Even the people who love them?"</p>
        <p>"Oh, yes."</p>
        <p>"Is that anything more than plain selfishness?"</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't know," I smiled.</p>
        <p>"What can be the possible use of Larry’s learning dead languages?"</p>
        <p>"Some people have a disinterested desire for knowledge. It's not an ignoble desire."</p>
        <p>"What's the good of knowledge if you're not going to do anything with it?"</p>
        <p>"Perhaps he is. Perhaps it will be sufficient satisfaction merely to know, as it's a sufficient satisfaction to an artist to produce a work of art. And perhaps it's only a step towards something further."</p>
        <p>"If he wanted knowledge why couldn't he go to college when he came back from the war? It's what Dr. Nelson and Mamma wanted him to do."</p>
        <p>"I talked to him about that in Chicago. A degree would be of no use to him. I have an inkling that he had a definite idea of what he wanted and felt he couldn't get it at a university. You know, in learning there's the lone wolf as well as the wolf who runs in the pack. I think Larry is one of those persons who can go no other way than their own."</p>
        <p>"I remember once asking him if he wanted to write. He laughed and said he had nothing to write about."</p>
        <p>"That's the most inconclusive reason for not writing that I've ever heard," I smiled.</p>
        <p>Isabel made a gesture of impatience. She was in no mood even for the mildest jest.</p>
        <p>"What I can't make out is why he should have turned out like this. Before the war he was just like everybody else. You wouldn't think it, but he plays a very good game of tennis and he's quite a decent golfer. He used to do all the things the rest of us did. He was a perfectly normal boy and there was no reason to suppose he wouldn't become a perfectly normal man. After all you're a novelist, you ought to be able to explain it."</p>
        <p>"Who am I to explain the infinite complexities of human nature?"</p>
        <p>"That's why I wanted to talk to you today," she added, taking no notice of what I said.</p>
        <p>"Are you unhappy?"</p>
        <p>"No, not exactly unhappy. When Larry isn't there I'm all right; it's when I'm with him that I feel so weak. Now it's just a sort of ache, like the stiffness you get after a long ride when you haven't been on a horse for months; it's not pain, it's not at all unbearable, but you're conscious of it. I shall get over it all right. I hate the idea of Larry making such a mess of his life."</p>
        <p>"Perhaps he won't. It's a long, arduous road he's starting to travel, but it may be that at the end of it he'll find what he's seeking."</p>
        <p>"What's that?"</p>
        <p>"Hasn't it occurred to you? It seems to me that in what he said to you he indicated it pretty plainly. God."</p>
        <p>"God!" she cried. But it was an exclamation of incredulous surprise. Our use of the same word, but in such a different sense, had a comic effect, so that we were obliged to laugh. But Isabel immediately grew serious again and I felt in her whole attitude something like fear. "What on earth makes you think that?"</p>
        <p>"I'm only guessing. But you asked me to tell you what I thought as a novelist. Unfortunately you don't know what experience he had in the war that so profoundly moved him. I think it was some sudden shock for which he was unprepared. I suggest to you that whatever it was that happened to Larry filled him with a sense of the transiency of life, and an anguish to be sure that there was a compensation for the sin and sorrow of the world."</p>
        <p>I could see that Isabel didn't like the turn I had given the conversation. It made her feel shy and awkward.</p>
        <p>"Isn't all that awfully morbid? One has to take the world as it comes. If we're here, it's surely to make the most of life."</p>
        <p>"You're probably right."</p>
        <p>"I don't pretend to be anything but a perfectly normal, ordinary girl. I want to have fun."</p>
        <p>"It looks as though there were complete incompatibility of temper between you. It's much better that you should have found it out before marriage."</p>
        <p>"I want to marry and have children and live——"</p>
        <p>"In that state of life in which a merciful Providence has been pleased to place you," I interrupted, smiling.</p>
        <p>"Well, there's no harm in that, is there? It's a very pleasant state and I'm quite satisfied with it."</p>
        <p>"You're like two friends who want to take their holiday together, but one of them wants to climb Greenland's icy mountains while the other wants to fish off India's coral strand. Obviously it's not going to work."</p>
        <p>"Anyway, I might get a sealskin coat off Greenland's icy mountains, and I think it's very doubtful if there are any fish off India's coral strand."</p>
        <p>"That remains to be seen."</p>
        <p>"Why d'you say that?" she asked, frowning a little. "All the time you seem to be making some sort of mental reservation. Of course I know that I'm not playing the star part in this. Larry's got that. He's the idealist, he's the dreamer of a beautiful dream, and even if the dream doesn't come true, it's rather thrilling to have dreamt it. I'm cast for the hard, mercenary, practical part. Common sense is never very sympathetic, is it? But what you forget is that it's I who'd have to pay. Larry would sweep along, trailing clouds of glory, and all there'd be left for me would be to tag along and make both ends meet. I want to live."</p>
        <p>"I don't forget that at all. Years ago, when I was young, I knew a man who was a doctor, and not a bad one either, but he didn't practise. He spent years burrowing away in the library of the British Museum and at long intervals produced a huge pseudo-scientific, pseudo-philosophical book that nobody read and that he had to publish at his own expense. He wrote four or five of them before he died and they were absolutely worthless. He had a son who wanted to go into the army, but there was no money to send him to Sandhurst, so he had to enlist. He was killed in the war. He had a daughter too. She was very pretty and I was rather taken with her. She went on the stage, but she had no talent and she traipsed around the provinces playing small parts in second-rate companies at a miserable salary. His wife, after years of dreary, sordid drudgery broke down in health and the girl had to come home and nurse her and take on the drudgery her mother no longer had the strength for. Wasted, thwarted lives and all to no purpose. It's a toss-up when you decide to leave the beaten track. Many are called but few are chosen."
        </p>
        <p>"Mother and Uncle Elliott approve of what I've done. Do you approve too?"</p>
        <p>"My dear, what can that matter to you? I'm almost a stranger to you."</p>
        <p>"I look upon you as a disinterested observer," she said, with a pleasant smile. "I should like to have your approval. You do think I've done right, don't you?"</p>
        <p>"I think you've done right for you," I said, fairly confident that she would not catch the slight distinction I made in my reply.</p>
        <p>"Then why have I a bad conscience?"</p>
        <p>"Have you?"</p>
        <p>With a smile still on her lips, but a slightly rueful smile now, she nodded.</p>
        <p>"I know it's only horse sense. I know that every reasonable person would agree that I've done the only possible thing. I know that from every practical standpoint, from the standpoint of worldly wisdom, from the standpoint of common decency, from the standpoint of what's right and wrong, I've done what I ought to do. And yet at the bottom of my heart I've got an uneasy feeling that if I were better, if I were more disinterested, more unselfish, nobler, I'd marry Larry and lead his life. If I only loved him enough I'd think the world well lost."</p>
        <p>"You might put it the other way about. If he loved you enough he wouldn't have hesitated to do what you want."</p>
        <p>"I've said that to myself too. But it doesn't help. I suppose it's more in woman's nature to sacrifice herself than in a man's." She chuckled. "Ruth and the alien corn and all that sort of thing."</p>
        <p>"Why don't you risk it?"</p>
        <p>We had been talking quite lightly, almost as if we were having a casual conversation about people we both knew but in whose affairs we were not intimately concerned, and even when she narrated to me her talk with Larry, Isabel had spoken with a sort of breezy gaiety, enlivening it with humour, as if she did not want me to take what she said too seriously.</p>
        <p>But now she went pale.</p>
        <p>"I'm afraid."</p>
        <p>For a while we were silent. A chill went down my spine as it strangely does when I am confronted with deep and genuine human emotion. I find it terrible and rather awe-inspiring.</p>
        <p>"Do you love him very much?" I asked at last.</p>
        <p>"I don't know. I'm impatient with him. I'm exasperated with him. I keep longing for him."</p>
        <p>Silence again fell upon us. I didn't know what to say. The coffee-room in which we sat was small, and heavy lace curtains over the window shut out the light. On the walls, covered with yellow marbled paper, were old sporting prints. With its mahogany furniture, its shabby leather chairs and its musty smell it was strangely reminiscent of a coffee-room in a Dickens novel. I poked the fire and put more coal on it. Isabel suddenly began to speak.</p>
        <p>"You see, I thought when it came to a showdown he'd knuckle under. I knew he was weak."</p>
        <p>"Weak?" I cried. "What made you think that? A man who for a year withstood the disapproval of all his friends and associates because he was determined to go his own way."</p>
        <p>"I could always do anything I wanted with him. I could turn him round my little finger. He was never a leader in the things we did. He just tagged along with the crowd."</p>
        <p>I had lit a cigarette and watched the smoke ring I had made. It grew larger and larger and then faded away into the air. "Mamma and Elliott thought it very wrong of me to go about with him afterwards as though nothing had happened, but I didn't take it very seriously. I kept on thinking up to the end that he'd yield. I couldn't believe that when he'd got it into his thick head that I meant what I said he wouldn't give in." She hesitated and gave me a smile of roguish, playful malice. "Will you be awfully shocked if I tell you something?"</p>
        <p>"I think it very unlikely."</p>
        <p>"When we decided to come to London, I called Larry and asked him if we couldn't spend my last evening in Paris together. When I told them, Uncle Elliott said it was most improper and Mamma said she thought it unnecessary. When Mamma says something is unnecessary it means she thoroughly disapproves. Uncle Elliott asked me what the idea was and I said we were going to dine somewhere and then make a tour of the night clubs. He told Mamma she ought to forbid me to go. Mamma said, 'Will you pay any attention if I forbid you to go?' 'No, darling,' I said, 'none.' Then she said, 'That is what I imagined. In that case there doesn't seem to be much point in my forbidding it.' "</p>
        <p>"Your mother appears to be a woman of enormous sense."</p>
        <p>"I don't believe she misses much. When Larry called for me I went into her room to say good night to her. I'd made up a bit; you know, you have to in Paris or else you look so naked, and when she saw the dress I had on, I had an uneasy suspicion from the way she took me in from top to toe that she had a pretty shrewd idea what I was after. But she didn't say anything. She just kissed me and said she hoped I'd have a good time."</p>
        <p>"What were you after?"</p>
        <p>Isabel looked at me doubtfully, as though she couldn't quite decide how frank she was prepared to be.</p>
        <p>"I didn't think I was looking too bad and it was my last chance. Larry had reserved a table at Maxim's. We had lovely things to eat, all the things I particularly liked, and we had champagne. We talked our heads off, at least I did, and I made Larry laugh. One of the things I've liked about him is that I can always amuse him. We danced. When we'd had enough of that we went on to the Chateau de Madrid. We found some people we knew and joined them and we had more champagne. Then we all went to the Acacia. Larry dances quite well, and we fit. The heat and the music and the wine—I was getting a bit light-headed. I felt absolutely reckless. I danced with my face against Larry's and I knew he wanted me. God knows I wanted him. I had an idea. I suppose it had been at the back of my mind all the time. I thought I'd get him to come home with me and once I'd got him there, well, it was almost inevitable that the inevitable should happen."</p>
        <p>"Upon my word you couldn't put it more delicately."</p>
        <p>"My room was quite a way from Uncle Elliott's and Mamma's, so I knew there was no risk. When we were back in America I thought I'd write and say I was going to have a baby. He'd be obliged to come back and marry me, and when I'd got him home I didn't believe it would be hard to keep him there, especially with Mamma ill. 'What a fool I am not to have thought of that before,' I said to myself. 'Of course that'll settle everything.' When the music stopped I just stayed there in his arms. Then I said it was getting late and we had to take the train at noon, so we'd better go. We got into a taxi. I nestled close to him and he put his arms around me and kissed me. He kissed me, he kissed me—oh, it was heaven. It hardly seemed a moment before the taxi stopped at the door. Larry paid it.</p>
        <p>" 'I shall walk home,' he said.</p>
        <p>"The taxi rattled off and I put my arms round his neck.</p>
        <p>" 'Won't you come up and have one last drink?' I said.</p>
        <p>" 'Yes, if you like,' he said,</p>
        <p>"He'd rung the bell and the door swung open. He switched on the light as we stepped in, I looked into his eyes. They were so trusting, so honest, so—so guileless; he so obviously hadn't the smallest idea that I was laying a trap for him; I felt I couldn't play him such a dirty trick. It was like taking candy off a child. D'you know what I did? I said, 'Oh well, perhaps you'd better not. Mamma's not very well tonight and if she's fallen asleep I don't want to wake her up. Good night.' I put my face up for him to kiss and pushed him out of the door. That was the end of that."</p>
        <p>"Are you sorry?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"I'm neither pleased nor sorry. I just couldn't help myself. It wasn't me that did what I did. It was just an impulse that took possession of me and acted for me." She grinned. "I suppose you'd call it my better nature."</p>
        <p>"I suppose you would."</p>
        <p>"Then my better nature must take the consequences. I trust in the future it'll be more careful."</p>
        <p>That was in effect the end of our talk. It may be that it was some consolation to Isabel to have been able to speak to someone with entire freedom, but that was all the good I had been able to do her. Feeling I had been inadequate, I tried to say at least some small thing that would give her comfort.</p>
        <p>"You know, when one's in love," I said, "and things go all wrong, one's terribly unhappy and one thinks one won't ever get over it. But you'll be astounded to learn what the sea will do."</p>
        <p>"What do you mean?" she smiled.</p>
        <p>"Well, love isn't a good sailor and it languishes on a sea voyage. You'll be surprised when you have the Atlantic between you and Larry to find how slight the pang is that before you sailed seemed intolerable."</p>
        <p>"Do you speak from experience?"</p>
        <p>"From the experience of a stormy past. When I suffered from the pangs of unrequited love I immediately got on an ocean liner."</p>
        <p>The rain showed no sign of letting up, so we decided that Isabel could survive without seeing the noble pile of Hampton Court or even Queen Elizabeth's bed, and drove back to London, I saw her two or three times after that, but only when other people were present, and then, having had enough of London for a while, I set off for the Tyrol.</p>

    <p>You are going to get validation in your life from somewhere. I would urge you to seriously look at where you are currently getting that validation. Your social circle? Some quality about you that you take pride in? Your work and accomplishments? Your significant other? You know, growing up I was told to think about my future. And I truly know that I now have. For these mere decades of dust bound to gravity and earth are absolutely nothing compared to the greatness that awaits for those of faith in Jesus in the life to come. That's my future - Jesus Christ, by His grace alone. Think about your future - do not all paths lead to death? What's your plan - when death is no longer restricted from sweeping you and all that you did away forever?</p>
    <li>*</li>
    <p>So think about your future. But in addition to thinking 10, 20, 30 years in the future, please, for the sake of your soul, think 100, 200, 300 years in the future and ask yourself, "To what end do I live this way?" I tell you dearly, I have thought at great length and depth of matters such as these, and our hope is only in the love shown by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the way, the truth, and the life. All else is distraction that subtly and sinisterly kills. But in and through Christ, we have clarity for our minds, the truest joy imaginable in our hearts, and, finally, the ability to love and live how we were meant to before, tragically, we thought it fit to make ourselves the god of our life. Truly I tell you that endeavor only ends with death. But take heart, for true love and life is out there and He wants you to open your heart to getting to know Him!</p>
    <li>*</li>
    <p>We all have faith in something. What are the fruits of your faith?</p>
    </p>
    <p><u>Galatians 5:22-23</u></p>
    <p class="phosphate">"But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law."</p>
    <p><u>1 John 4:16</u></p>
    <p class="phosphate">"And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them."</p>
    <p><u>1 Corinthians 13:4-8</u></p>
    <p class="phosphate">"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away."</p>
    <p><u>Romans 5:1</u></p>
    <p class="phosphate">"Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
    <p><u>Proverbs 10:24-25</u></p>
    <p class="phosphate">"What the wicked dread will overtake them; what the righteous desire will be granted. When the storm has swept by, the wicked are gone, but the righteous stand firm forever."</p>
    <p>And perhaps the most valuable realization out there -</p>
    <p>God saw that wisdom needed to be and Job 28:28 is it.</p>
    <p><u>Job 28:28</u></p>
    <p class="phosphate">"And unto man he said, behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding."</p>
    <p>That's it. That's wisdom.</p>
    <p>Oh to travel back in time, and do it all differently - with real wisdom at our heels.</p>
    <p>You know what I'd do? I'd go back in time, livid at myself, lucid in wisdom, bust down the front door, sprint over to my mangled body, shake myself senseless, and yell as loudly as possible, at the top of my lungs, so everyone could hear:</p>
    <h1><b><u><i>Love is so much better than this!</i></u></b></h1>

    <p><b>Author's note:</b></p>
    <p><b>And so, though it is my great wish to edit the following of parts five through seven until I am satisfied with their fluidity, I'm humbled by a dove who came from heaven, and this bird has ordered some of his servants to begin closing up shop here on earth, for truly, He is at the very gates. Therefore, I find it prudent to get this message out, at the expense of the lack of readiness of the remainder of these parts. Perhaps I will have time at a later date to revise accordingly. God bless you!!!</b></p>
    <p>And these are my thoughts on the struggle bred in this world of transforming despair into joy, a feat only accomplished courtesy of His upholding:
      <ul>
        <li>I want to cry. I want to weep for joy and ball for despair. I want peace, happiness, and love. I want the highest quality. I want to understand truth. I want to both enjoy and figure out life for its beauty and ripeness. I want to create and experience gorgeous, diverse, fascinating stories. But based on past experience, and the present silence, I need to zip my lip and go far off somewhere.</li>
        <br />
        <li>One of my dreams is to relax in my existence, rest my gaze upon the colorful sunset, and roll around the candy of an aphoristic teaching with my tongue, sucking the thought from a billion different flavors, and digesting love.</li>
        <br />
        <li>I was and am a black sheep. I will strive to welcome and love all sheep no matter what.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Step back, smile, and give the camera a wink. You're in on the façade of the adult world. Enjoy the charade, as it is the fakest thing you will encounter.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Woe! And look and feel and behold as I tell unto you this story set to unfold. A long ways away man said to God, I'm king! And behold man looked down at his finger and took off his ring! And so man was wed to himself and therefore despair! Because good wasn't in him because God wasn't there! No magnitude of broken souls will repay that decision to disobey, thank Adam for that and to Jesus I urge you pray "ho! Good lord and mighty master of me! Forgive my sins and my countless utterings of blasphemy! Take me back home under your roof where I belong! And until that fateful day, on this journey I'll sing your song: "in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. He brought you and me into existence, and loves us past death and from birth!"</li>
        <br />
        <li>What an amazing thing that though the writer within me begs to see God as first an Artist, I know because of His Word that He is first the Father.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Most important thing you can say to someone? "I'm with you". If you’re reading this, may you believe it for yourself, <i>I’m with you.</i></li>
        <br />
        <li>Everything is a reflection of God's truth. Man is made in the image of God, and all that happens in man's world is metaphors that adhere to God's character. Everything is set in motion by God who cares about individual souls and hearts and minds and is choosing to portray everything in its way so that every individual lives what is necessary for the glorification of the Son and the opportunity of ultimate freedom and love and relationship with the individual (with the sons) (Spirit and father and son). Everything is relationship. What are the relationships of earth that you know of as a man and what are their heavenly correlation/metaphor?</li>
        <br />
        <li>So, against all odds, and despite the pride of man, everything that the wicked do, God uses for the benefit of the righteous.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Though I have wounded myself yet again, ere tomorrow I implore the night to ready itself as it may, for the sun is rising with a sharpness that will pierce the darkness forever, and behold, in its foolishness it forgets it is bleeding out, even this very moment, from the rays of the truest righteousness.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Oh how unendingly fond I am of never growing up - I'll save them all in the rye if I can!</li>
        <br />
        <li>I am very careful about growing up. Because once you do, there's no going back. Not really. So I must tread lightly, and be sure I am taking all of the good with me into the next part of life and dropping all the bad for good.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Born with taste buds, I, like you, found the sweetness of candy a delight. But then I stepped back, my tongue retracted back into my heart, and I knew that an eternity of such flavor would be a mistake of existence. I was reminded that there is no such thing, and inferred the inevitable - that digesting the capacity to see beyond was all the nutrition I could ever want, much less need. The result is that I'm drowning - not in fear or despair or any of those lies - but in overwhelming joy. I've found it. What everyone's looking for. It is greater than I can describe. It is by my side. It is within me and around me. And it is within reach, much more so than you would think. It changes the color of everything to its true and vibrant hue. And I want you to see it too.</li>
        <br />
        <li>When you have just peaked a mountain, and you can feel the success of the strain in your muscles, and you are among fellow brothers and sisters in this familial hike up a hill. When you are high up on this hill, and the air is crisp and the night is pure, and your eyes gradually curve upward, even higher than the horizon that is enmeshed by jagged rolling mountains, and your gaze perfectly creeps ever upward until all of your vision is consumed by only the night sky. In that moment, when industry and commerce are far-fetched nothings, and the only thing in your ears is the echo of the crunch that your foot makes in the snow on the way up, when your neck is stretched to the heavens, and you begin to witness the exasperating light emanating from the earth's ceiling - galaxies, suns, and even some homely planets - a myriad of beauty and speckled perfection...in this exact moment, if you find sound reason to be cynical, if you find death better than life, if you find sadness better than joy...then that is when I'll concede that you're actually a cynic. Otherwise, you have just been searching to complain.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>How can one describe that indescribable love, that brotherhood, that deep sense of simultaneous understanding, appreciation, admiration, adoration, and connection that is bound by self-sacrifice and upheld by faith. How can one describe that which can only be felt - that which has the power to illuminate even the dungeons of your heart with energetic bliss.</li>
        <br />
        <li>I would rather listen to one soul share its story than share my own to a thousand.</li>
        <br />
        <li>A whole lot in me said I should never jump from a plane but my mind liked to forget that, by now, I had a state of the art parachute, and, the most encouraging thing of all - I knew the pilot and he told me that the whole plane ride is meant for skydiving, not sitting safely in the confines of the plane, gawking at the world outside the window.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Life is like a plane and all the people on it are all geared up to sky dive. There's a window in your life where you can sky dive and soar through life and people are going to urge you to jump with them. Some people jump and life is a wild ride. Some people are full of fear and keep their gear on but stay on the plane and the plane safely lands in the end. Still fun, but not quite skydiving.</li>
        <br />
        <li>I can think of nothing more joyful than being young and taking a step toward fulfilling your soul.</li>
        <br />
        <li>This is the good news. You are created in God's image. You are cordially and wonderfully invited to have the privilege of representing God to the world for you are made in His image. The holy creator of all that you've ever known likewise created you and wants to be with you. Forever. His love for you is perfect. But you turned away from him and ran as far away from His kingdom as you could. You worshipped so many other things. You accumulated so many sins over the years. And the penalty of sin is death. But God loves you so much that he's not going to have you pay it. God's love is perfect. And He wants you in such an amazing way that He sent His very own son, Jesus Christ, to die so that you may live. God sacrificed his own son for you. That is how much he loves you. The good news is this: You are made and loved by God to a degree that you literally cannot imagine. This is the good news: Jesus Christ, God's son, died for your sins so that you may live forever in glory and wonder and joy and love with God, just like God wanted since day one. Wow! Now that is something to leap with joy for!
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Perhaps the right word is value. We all seek to be of value. And if we do not get that from something, our lives begin to fall apart. With Christ Jesus, the soul knows its value. That is what I want other people to know - the true extent to which they are loved by God. How much He loves us is the good news.</li>
        <br />
        <li>We will all justify what we want to do so that we feel right in doing what we want to do so that we may experience what we want to experience. So the question is…what do you want to do? Why do you want to do it? And who do you want to be? Do you want money, success, fame, sex, power, comfort, social victory, physical victory, or do you want MORE DAMNIT YOU CAN HAVE SO MUCH MORE BUT YOU HAVE TO WANT TO HAVE IT AND TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE CONTENT TO WANT WHAT IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM AND WHAT IS FLEETING INSTEAD OF QUESTIONING THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS AND AIMING FOR GREATER AND GREATER WONDERS AS THEY WERE MEANT TO. But, woe and behold, for we all choose who we become, and our God is a perfect one who grants us full responsibility for ourselves.</li>
        <br />
        <li>When you take your children to a playground you don't say the reason why you're here is to climb this particular ladder. You let them be free to enjoy what they wish. So it is with this world.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Nobody knows what they are doing. Infinite illusions surround us and bombard us with their presence. And we believe some and reject others. And we think some are better than others. And we fail to see how, on some level, we are only creatures, with screwed up psychologies and personalities, unable to know truth, and see truth because of our human limitations - hopelessly blabbering about things that simply don't matter in the grand sense - blindly seeking nothing but attention and self-satisfaction - aimlessly tethered to routine - at the whims of rationalized philosophies - searching for a place to belong that may or may not exist - provoked by endless patterns...life undeserving of life - ... Which is why written word is so fascinating and reviving to take part in - any order of letters instantly attains perfection in one's own imagination - something truer than what is referred to as the world around us is surprisingly internal, dwelling within the confines of your own mind. Hence, any object of thought's degree of truth is only as true as one's belief in that object of thought (common fallacies include presuppositions, generalizations, stereotyping, and/or anything that has the possibility of leading to some form of misjudgment). Regardless of whatever philosophy is believed and acted on, there's something more to this world than what is conventional.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>There's nothing to win here, on board a stranded lifeboat.</li>
        <br />
        <li>It does not make sense to be jealous over what you directly encounter, for if you realized the immensity of experience present that you never encounter, then you would immediately understand the futility behind such a mindset with your natural limitations.</li>
        <br />
        <li>“Give me joy! Give me laughter! Numb me to the despair and hopelessness and difficulties around me. Allow me to wallow in simplicity. Cheap, effortless entertainment is my feast and I am happy with that. Let me see through the bewildering absurdity of all things and shield myself with laughter, assuring myself with the relief that because I do not directly see evil and convince myself that my questionable deeds are not evil, I am a good person, with good intentions and a good heart.” - the world</li>
          <br />
        <li>IF I'M BEING AS HONEST AS POSSIBLE, I FOUND IT I FOUND IT I FOUND THE HIDDEN TREASURE THAT IS ALL OUR SOUL TOILS FOR</li>

      <h2><u>PART 6 - BRILLIANCE THROUGH TRAGEDY</u></h2>
      <p>All that is necessary, insofar as we are in this period of grace, is the degree of your faith in these few but heavy lines of truth, and that the depth of your faith in this truth grips you to the core and transforms who you are:</p>
      <p><u>1 Corinthians 15:1-4:</u></p>
      <p>Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you – unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>And these thoughts touch on how, through Jesus Christ, we have brilliance made through our tragedies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Though emptiness will scratch and claw at love, trying in vain to burst its fullness, let it be known that nothing in all of creation can escape the connection that love cultivates. You have been loved!</li>
          <br />
          <li>Feel the beauty ~~~ how can I share this with the world?</li>
          <br />
          <li>I want to look a brother or a sister in the eye and hold out my hand with agape love, breaking the shackles of their insecurity and raising them up, to love, just like God did to me, and just like God is doing right now.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Look into the eyes of your fellow brothers and sisters with love, for you all desire the same beautiful thing - the love and respect that God lovingly provides.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The gospel = the sheer love that is within our God for us, shown by the life and sacrifice and resurrection in Christ Jesus</li>
          <br />
          <li>Not only does true fear of God cultivate love, but knowing His greatness and majesty and depth reminds us that every evil thing against us, especially as followers and seekers of Him, is nothing. He is so unbelievably more mighty than it all.</li>
          <br />
          <li>How you treat others and how you treat the world is a direct correlation to how you treat yourself.</li>
          <br />
          <li>You don't become a Christian to get anything but Jesus Christ, Himself. All else is vanity. But few recognize the everlasting fulfillment in Him.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Initiative, persistence, and love for the process - indeed all processes of life are under the highest process - God unfolding himself to people and the world as He sees fit. Love the good times and good state of mind, for its own sake is a gift, but also do your best to love the bad times and the bad states of mind for the Lord has many blessings in disguise so as to teach and form and instruct and love His children in many spectacular ways.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Let us face ourselves in honesty. One of the main reasons you are reluctant to step back from faith in this world and put your faith in an everlasting one is because it is all you know. And also, because you don't want to wrestle with the reality that a lot of what you like to do, is wrong. Even the person who loves to do good things and loves to help others easily falls into the trap of doing so for, at its root, self-aggrandizing purposes.</li>
          <br />
          <li>"Only the unloved hate."</li>
          <br />
          <li>First you must understand what it means that you are something created by something that loves you with over a million tons of force. And try to understand the glory that it is to be a human being!</li>
          <br />
          <li>What I'm trying to tell you, really, is that now, I am not even afraid of death, because I know my Lord conquered death for both me and you. I do not want to die. But death holds no fear over me, for I know to my core that Christ conquered death. I am only fearful of the depth of goodness that I perceive to be in our Father in Heaven, the grace provided by His Son, Jesus Christ, and the love that the Holy Spirit cultivates in those that accept Him.</li>
          <br />
          <li>I perceived from above that all variables of life are present and in their proper places in order to first, glorify the Son, and second, transform the hearts of sinners from the vanity of themselves to the fullness only found in God.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Tragically, those with attention learn to say not what is right but what their audience agrees with.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The world will try to sedate you, to drug you, to fill you with lies like "I am not worthy of the love of God" or "Be complacent with who you are right now" or "Waste time doing what is ultimately nothing over here". The brilliant part is that God gives us the message and the right to refuse to listen to that and to turn our attention toward Him and His work.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The setting and experience of one's life itself does not matter, for in the love of God, everything is fulfilling no matter the circumstances, no matter the implications. As time progresses under the umbrella of Jesus Christ, Truth inevitably reveals itself, and the glory of Him can be seen in all things.</li>
          <br />
          <li>***If only the totality of his incomparable love could be realized every single waking moment. If only the fullness of his undeniable beauty could be witnessed with all good. And the most astounding fact of all existence, it can be realized so and it will be realized greatly.</li>
          <br />
          <li>What Jesus offers is what we need. What he has done, is doing, and will do, is for our best interests and in order to fulfill all that our heart desires.</li>
          <br />
          <li>How do we not know that that understanding, that faith, it’s there in all of us. It’s just either unrealized or communicated poorly.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Jesus gets crucified for blasphemy, because "he, a mere man, claimed to be God". The absolutely mind-blowing aspect of this is that the King of the universe is getting crucified/dying for the sins of everyone for claiming to be God when that is what everyone he is dying for claims in their sinful hearts (that they are God). It is beyond perfect of an act.</li>
          <br />
          <li>If you are breathing, then forgiveness is in the air.</li>
          <br />
          <li>When every waking instant is as magical as Christmas morning through a child's eyes, where people are seen genuinely, segregated from unrighteous judgment, where brothers and sisters of all folds and species and kinds are united through the ultimate, the infinite, the loving one.</li>
          <br />
          <li>My favorite thing of all things is, undoubtedly, story. But only because the idea of story is not limited to words on a page or images on a screen. Do you not know that your mind is the author and your body the pen? And underlying all of these tangled characters, a master writer is present, composing eloquently the story of Life as we know it now. And thank everything you've ever known that Life is not what you expect, because if it was then it would be far from what it actually is - perfection. Do you hear the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfQ94EXIpTc&list=FLapVEeYNjyEOWKH_Y-fCMaw&index=114" target="_blank"><b>music</b></a> in all things? The spirit behind the strum of the guitar. The emotion behind the eternal gaze of two lovers. The story behind the life of the individual.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Every footstep of yours is a note, your life a symphony.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Oh with what swift and precise words I long to clarify the pangs of my heart. Only a reality as sadistic as sin could turn those that it possesses into such selfish blindness that they see the <i>root</i> of the problem of the world in one of themselves. The truth is that we are God's. But sin cursed that heavenly ownership. So we are all on the same team from the start, born drenched in sin, in brokenness, and the problem is sin, is evil, is anything not done in accordance with faith in God. Because God is telling a story through creation. And I believe that in the next life when we have all died and faded from these contoured sacks of flesh, one thing of truth of life on earth may be said: "This is what happens when you don't listen to God." A loving father knows what is best for his children, wants what is best for his children, provides what is best for his children. And in this reality of sin, God seeks to save us from the void of evil that we have given our hearts and minds and souls over to by redemption in Him through His Son, Jesus Christ. One of many points being: we are ALL ON THE SAME SIDE HERE. IT IS SIN THAT DIVIDES US AGAINST EACH OTHER. WE COULD BE CO-CONSPIRATORS ALL ON A RIGHTEOUS PATH TO TRUTH AND JUSTICE AND LOVE AND LIGHT BUT BEHOLD AS IT IS WRITTEN - HUMANS LOVED THE DARKNESS MORE.

      <h2><u>PART 7 - CONCLUSION</u></h2>
      <p>And a conclusion of sorts. May God bless you on your journey!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have to trust that God's will is so much greater for you and everything about you than your own will for your life and who you think you want to become.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Call it cliché. Call it unrealistic. Call it whatever you want but I call it truth - the only thing limiting you is yourself.</li>
        <br />
        <li>It is from a deep realization of the evil in the people around me and in myself that I must cling to the goodness in my life. Lord Jesus, come quickly and may the vengeance that is yours be absolute and devastating to all sin.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Just as the earth orbits the sun, so too are we meant to orbit other persons, as creatures borne in the image of God, who is an eternal perfect state of orbiting distinct persons within Himself. Sin is self-centeredness. Trying to get everything or anything to orbit around you. Trying to be the center of the moment. You only realize the fullness of true love and true life when you give the moment to someone else, to God. For in loving others, we love God, for God is selfless love.</li>
        <br />
        <li>"Did you hear me and do you think that any of it mattered"</li>
        <br />
        <li>Get to know Jesus Christ and if you cannot find the motivation in yourself to do that than at least do that thing you've always wanted to do RIGHT NOW, because these days pass by like a shadow.</li>
        <br />
        <li>If we remembered the truth of the foresight and foreknowledge that God has, we too would see the vanity of this world. God holds the keys to eternity and whatever is with Him will make it.</li>
        <br />
        <li>All life is an attempt to share the joy found in the love of God.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Faith is perfect because nothing is overtly forced. Service is voluntary never mandated.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Invariably, the naturalistic response will be reluctance. Many may believe that people ought to pursue "whatever makes them happy" or "contribute to society" or "do what's right for themselves". But these paths are foolishness in and of themselves because what makes a person happy is relative, any contribution to society that a human makes is negated by the immense corruption and evil that is a staple of life on Earth soaked in sin, and who knows what is right for oneself? Happiness is a transitory state of mind that ebbs and flows and death knocks it down forever. Think of your ancestors and the great characters of the past. Where is their happiness now? Society is a transitory state of human life that ebbs and flows and death knocks it down forever. Think of your ancestors and the great civilizations of the past. Where is their glory now? Think about the many paths and decisions and choices one makes in one's life. The "best choices" can lead to total destruction of the individual and the "worst choices" can lead to total fulfillment of the individual. Who knows what is right in general? Who knows what is right for a person? We are all caught up with ourselves and our current fixation of self-narrative, whether we know it or not. Many of us worry for the future, stress about the present, and regret the past, whether it is conscious or subconscious. The point I want to make is this: Think of your ancestors and the billions and billions of people that have been born, lived, laughed, cried, talked, and died. Where is their fear for the future, their stress for the present, and their troublesome past? Death knocks it down, and we fear over nothing. That's why the gift of life is the present moment, no matter where you are. If you have the right heart and stance about life, you can actually be in awe of the depth of beauty around you, and be genuine and joyful for the now. Because the key to remember is that the now is slipping away and fast and before you know it, you'll be either dead or dying, and you'll think crazy thoughts like "how did I get here?" and "where did all the time go?" and "did I live a life that I can honestly be proud of?" and "did I love my family well, my friends well, and even my enemies, did I love them well?" and "was I filled with confusion and hate and disdain for others or rather clarity and love and forgiveness for others?". Questions like these will scrape across your mind at some point, whether consciously or subconsciously, and you will either answer with glee, answer with regret, or refuse to respond out of fear for exposing the truth, which is, of course, that you were not your best self. But that's life. That's life.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>I looked into the dead eyes of my brothers and sisters and from deep within their hearts they cried out with despair, declaring "ugliness, ugliness, behold, this world is ugliness" but I solemnly stared back at them, befuddled with a grimace in my heart, masking my befuddlement of them with a smile on my face though, swearing from my soul "but we see what we are, and the greatest pair of eyes is beautiful, I promise". But in their vanity they heard nothing and perished without a reasonable word, no more. They were no more.</li>
        <br />
        <li>All of us are searching, whether we know it or not. And you will search and search and drink of every possible thing that can fill you up in the interim. You will fill yourself up on morsels of scraps, not knowing that the opportunity to feast is always within you and around you and especially above you. You will go down many paths, confident that their end will justify your journey, forgetting that there is only one thing that matters - love - and there is only one example of true love - Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. All else is illusion, distraction, destruction - in place to deter you from connecting to who you were created to connect with. I wonder how long it will take you to realize that the waters of the world that you continually drink of - be it your significant other, your body, your social status or circle, your income, your career, your contribution to society, your selfish selflessness, your vainglory, your hatred of those different than you, your lack of empathy for every individual who is walking through life beside you, or some other drained well - before it is clear that ALL OF THE ABOVE WILL LEAD TO DEATH IF YOU MAKE ANY OF IT YOUR PRIORITY. THERE IS ONE PATH TO LIFE, ONE PERSON THAT THIS GREAT STORY OF LIFE IS ALL ABOUT AND IT IS NOT YOU BUT YOU ARE ALONG FOR THE RIDE, THE ONLY ISSUE IS WHETHER YOU ARE WITH OR AGAINST THE PROTAGONIST OF ALL CREATION, THE RECIPIENT OF ALL MOCKERY AND THE OBJECT OF ALL SCOFFERS, THE PROVIDER OF LASTING RICHES, THE LOVER OF SINNERS, THE PRIEST OF THE FALLEN, THE GUIDE FOR THE BROKEN-HEARTED, THE CREATOR OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH, THE LISTENER OF SORROWS, THE ANSWER TO ALL PRAYERS, THE FUEL OF ALL LIFE, THE GUARANTOR OF TRUTH - of course, I am talking about Jesus Christ who you will either recognize as King in this life in good graces or the next, at the mercy of His will.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>But there is one exception to all of this confusion. There is a constant love, a consistent force of good at work behind all things. Just because its methods are unexpected does not mean that they are not sound. Good will supplant bad in the end. It is only because grace is abounding in the present that evil exists and falsely appears to reign. There will come a day where evil reaches its inevitable fatality. It is true beyond nature that humans are not exempt from that fateful day. Listen to your heart that has been given to you by God, of God.</li>
        <br />
        <li>If you're reading this right now, then I desperately want you to understand what I'm saying. And all I'm saying is this: Life is amazing. God is good. And a life lived with the knowledge of the depth of love and grace of God is the ultimate way to live a spectacular life.</li>
        <br />
        <li>why people don't choose him: lack of faith/want of the world (see Romans 6)</li>
        <li>
          <p>First, there is a mind, an identity, a self. And that self is divinely ordained a purpose, either his own or His own. Regardless, His purpose prevailed, is prevailing, and will prevail. But to each his own purpose, respectively. Some degree of free will is necessary, for, if otherwise, we have no or zero control over our lives. There is one. And then there are divisions within that oneness of a particular nature that are manifested in reality. And all endeavors of and in life reflect the established nature of the Almighty One. And the Almighty One used, is using, and will use the endeavors of all created beings who have been given the breath of life, for His Holy Endeavor, which is just and good and love and true to Him and His nature and His character. Because of the terrifying and human-defying power of Him, along with His good will and perfect authorship, God speaks to us through everything – the cliché and blatant of which are His Word, prayer, and people. To the degree that God sees fit, and insofar as the state of one’s heart is in tune with the music of God, the eyes and ears of an individual may discern the voice of God, or what He wants to do and be for us, if we let Him. What is necessary then is that the individual recognizes the sheer and real depravity and vanity of self-centered life, as opposed to God-centered life.

    <h1>The Book of Ecclesiastes</h1>

    <div id="echapter1" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 1 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 1</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>All Is Vanity</i></u></h6>
      <p>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.</p>
      <p>What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?</p>
      <p>A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.</p>
      <p>The sun rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where it rises.</p>
      <p>The wind blows to the south and goes around to the north; around and around goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns.</p>
      <p>All streams run to the sea, but the sea is not full; to the place where the streams flow, there they flow again.</p>
      <p>All things are full of weariness; a man cannot utter it; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</p>
      <p>What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun.</p>
      <p>Is there a thing of which it is said, "See, this is new"? It has been already in the ages before us.</p>
      <p>There is no remembrance of former things, nor will there be any remembrance of later things yet to be among those who come after.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Wisdom</i></u></h6>
      <p>I the Preacher have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven. It is an unhappy business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.</p>
      <p>I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a striving after the wind.</p>
      <p>What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted.</p>
      <p>I said in my heart, "I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."</p>
      <p>And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind.</p>
      <p>For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="echapter2" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 2 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 2</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Self-Indulgence</i></u></h6>
      <p>I said in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself." But behold, this also was vanity.</p>
      <p>I said of laughter, "It is mad," and of pleasure, "What use is it?"</p>
      <p>I searched with my heart how to cheer my body with wine - my heart still guiding me with wisdom - and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the children of man to do under heaven during the few days of their life.</p>
      <p>I made great works. I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.</p>
      <p>I made myself gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.</p>
      <p>I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees.</p>
      <p>I bought male and female slaves, and had slaves who were born in my house. I had also great possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I got singers, both men and women, and many concubines, the delight of the sons of man.</p>
      <p>So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me.</p>
      <p>And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my reward for all my toil.</p>
      <p>Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Living Wisely</i></u></h6>
      <p>So I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly. For what can man do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done.</p>
      <p>Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness.</p>
      <p>The wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that the same event happens to all of them.</p>
      <p>Then I said in my heart, "What happens to the fool will happen to me also. Why then have I been so very wise?" And I said in my heart that this also is vanity.</p>
      <p>For of the wise as of the fool there is no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. How the wise dies just like the fool!</p>
      <p>So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for all is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Toil</i></u></h6>
      <p>I hated all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who will come after me,</p>
      <p>and who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.</p>
      <p>So I turned about and gave my heart up to despair over all the toil of my labors under the sun,</p>
      <p>because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.</p>
      <p>What has a man from all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun?</p>
      <p>For all his days are full of sorrow, and his work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.</p>
      <p>There is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God,</p>
      <p>for apart from him who can eat or who can have enjoyment?</p>
      <p>For to the one who pleases him God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given the business of gathering and collecting, only to give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="echapter3" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 3 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 3</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>A Time for Everything</i></u></h6>
      <p>For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:</p>
      <p>a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;</p>
      <p>a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</p>
      <p>a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</p>
      <p>a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</p>
      <p>a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</p>
      <p>a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</p>
      <p>a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The God-Given Task</i></u></h6>
      <p>What gain has the worker from his toil?</p>
      <p>I have seen the business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.</p>
      <p>He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man's heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.</p>
      <p>I perceived that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live;</p>
      <p>also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil - this is God's gift to man.</p>
      <p>I perceived that whatever God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God has done it, so that people fear before him.</p>
      <p>That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already has been; and God seeks what has been driven away.</p>
    <h6><u><i>From Dust to Dust</i></u></h6>
      <p>Moreover, I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, even there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness, even there was wickedness.</p>
      <p>I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work.</p>
      <p>I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but beasts.</p>
      <p>For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity.</p>
      <p>All go to one place. All are from the dust, and to dust all return.</p>
      <p>Who knows whether the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of the beast goes down into the earth?</p>
      <p>So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his work, for that is his lot. Who can bring him to see what will be after him?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="echapter4" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 4 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 4</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>Evil Under the Sun</i></u></h6>
      <p>Again I saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power, and there was no one to comfort them.</p>
      <p>And I thought the dead who are already dead more fortunate than the living who are still alive.</p>
      <p>But better than both is he who has not yet been and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.</p>
      <p>Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man's envy of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
      <p>The fool folds his hands and eats his own flesh.</p>
      <p>Better is a handful of quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind.</p>
      <p>Again, I saw vanity under the sun:</p>
      <p>one person who has no other, either son or brother, yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks, "For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?" This also is vanity and an unhappy business.</p>
      <p>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil.</p>
      <p>For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up!</p>
      <p>Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone?</p>
      <p>And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him - a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>
      <p>Better was a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knew how to take advice.</p>
      <p>For he went from prison to the throne, though in his own kingdom he had been born poor.</p>
      <p>I saw all the living who move about under the sun, along with that youth who was to stand in the king's place.</p>
      <p>There was no end of all the people, all of whom he led. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="echapter5" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 5 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 5</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>Fear God</i></u></h6>
      <p>Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. To draw near to listen is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil.</p>
      <p>Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore let your words be few.</p>
      <p>For a dream comes with much business, and a fool's voice with many words.</p>
      <p>When you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it, for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow.</p>
      <p>It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.</p>
      <p>Let not your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?</p>
      <p>For when dreams increase and words grow many, there is vanity; but God is the one you must fear.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Wealth and Honor</i></u></h6>
      <p>If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and righteousness, do not be amazed at the matter, for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them.</p>
      <p>But this is gain for a land in every way: a king committed to cultivated fields.</p>
      <p>He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity.</p>
      <p>When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes?</p>
      <p>Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.</p>
      <p>There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt,</p>
      <p>and those riches were lost in a bad venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand.</p>
      <p>As he came from his mother's womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand.</p>
      <p>This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what gain is there to him who toils for the wind?</p>
      <p>Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger.</p>
      <p>Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his lot.</p>
      <p>Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil - this is the gift of God.</p>
      <p>For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="echapter6" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 6 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 6</u></h4>
      <p>There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy on mankind:</p>
      <p>a man to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to enjoy them, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity; it is a grievous evil.</p>
      <p>If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with life's good things, and he also has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.</p>
      <p>For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness, and in darkness its name is covered.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it has not seen the sun or known anything, yet it finds rest rather than he.</p>
      <p>Even though he should live a thousand years twice over, yet enjoy no good - do not all go to the one place?</p>
      <p>All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied.</p>
      <p>For what advantage has the wise man over the fool? And what does the poor man have who knows how to conduct himself before the living?</p>
      <p>Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the appetite: this also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
      <p>Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what man is, and that he is not able to dispute with one stronger than he.</p>
      <p>The more words, the more vanity, and what is the advantage to man?</p>
      <p>For who knows what is good for man while he lives the few days of his vain life, which he passes like a shadow? For who can tell man what will be after him under the sun?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="echapter7" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 7 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 7</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>The Contrast of Wisdom and Folly</i></u></h6>
      <p>A good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of birth.</p>
      <p>It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for this is the end of all mankind, and the living will lay it to heart.</p>
      <p>Sorrow is better than laughter, for by sadness of face the heart is made glad.</p>
      <p>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</p>
      <p>It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise than to hear the song of fools.</p>
      <p>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fools; this also is vanity.</p>
      <p>Surely oppression drives the wise into madness, and a bribe corrupts the heart.</p>
      <p>Better is the end of a thing than its beginning, and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</p>
      <p>Be not quick in your spirit to become angry, for anger lodges in the heart of fools.</p>
      <p>Say not, "Why were the former days better than these?" For it is not from wisdom that you ask this.</p>
      <p>Wisdom is good with an inheritance, an advantage to those who see the sun.</p>
      <p>For the protection of wisdom is like the protection of money, and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.</p>
      <p>Consider the work of God: who can make straight what he has made crooked?</p>
      <p>In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.</p>
      <p>In my vain life I have seen everything. There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evildoing.</p>
      <p>Be not overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?</p>
      <p>Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool. Why should you die before your time?</p>
      <p>It is good that you should take hold of this, and from that withhold not your hand, for the one who fears God shall come out from both of them.</p>
      <p>Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.</p>
      <p>Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.</p>
      <p>Do not take to heart all the things that people say, lest you hear your servant cursing you.</p>
      <p>Your heart knows that many times you yourself have cursed others.</p>
      <p>All this I have tested by wisdom. I said, "I will be wise," but it was far from me.</p>
      <p>That which has been is far off, and deep, very deep; who can find it out?</p>
      <p>I turned my heart to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness that is madness.</p>
      <p>And I find something more bitter than death: the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is taken by her.</p>
      <p>Behold, this is what I found, says the Preacher, while adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things -</p>
      <p>which my soul has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. One man among a thousand I found, but a woman among all these I have not found.</p>
      <p>See, this alone I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.</p>

    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 8</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>Keep the King's Command</i></u></h6>
      <p>Who is like the wise? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.</p>
      <p>I say: Keep the king's command, because of God's oath to him.</p>
      <p>Be not hasty to go from his presence. Do not take your stand in an evil cause, for he does whatever he pleases.</p>
      <p>For the word of the king is supreme, and who may say to him, "What are you doing?"</p>
      <p>Whoever keeps a command will know no evil thing, and the wise heart will know the proper time and the just way.</p>
      <p>For there is a time and a way for everything, although man's trouble lies heavy on him.</p>
      <p>For he does not know what is to be, for who can tell him how it will be?</p>
      <p>No man has power to retain the spirit, or power over the day of death. There is no discharge from war, nor will wickedness deliver those who are given to it.</p>
      <p>All this I observed while applying my heart to all that is done under the sun, when man had power over man to his hurt.</p>
    <h6><u><i>Those Who Fear God Will Do Well</i></u></h6>
      <p>Then I saw the wicked buried. They used to go in and out of the holy place and were praised in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity.</p>
      <p>Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the children of man is fully set to do evil.</p>
      <p>Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I know that it will be well with those who fear God, because they fear before him.</p>
      <p>But it will not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong his days like a shadow, because he does not fear before God.</p>
    <h6><u><i>Man Cannot Know God's Ways</i></u></h6>
      <p>There is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.</p>
      <p>And I commend joy, for man has nothing better under the sun but to eat and drink and be joyful, for this will go with him in his toil through the days of his life that God has given him under the sun.</p>
      <p>When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on earth, how neither day nor night do one's eyes see sleep,</p>
      <p>then I saw all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. However much man may toil in seeking, he will not find it out. Even though a wise man claims to know, he cannot find it out.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="echapter9" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 9 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 9</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>Death Comes to All</i></u></h6>
      <p>But all this I laid to heart, examing it all, how the righteous and the wise and their deeds are in the hand of God. Whether it is love or hate, man does not know; both are before him.</p>
      <p>It is the same for all, since the same event happens to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil, to the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As the good one is, so is the sinner, and he who swears is as he who shuns an oath.</p>
      <p>This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that the same event happens to all. Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</p>
      <p>But he who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</p>
      <p>For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.</p>
      <p>Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished, and forever they have no more share in all that is done under the sun.</p>
    <h6><u><i>Enjoy Life with the One You Love</i></u></h6>
      <p>Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved what you do.</p>
      <p>Let your garments be always white. Let not oil be lacking on your head.</p>
      <p>Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life that he has given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun.</p>
      <p>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might, for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.</p>
    <h6><u><i>Wisdom Better Than Folly</i></u></h6>
      <p>Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and chance happen to them all.</p>
      <p>For man does not know his time. Like fish that are taken in an evil net, and like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of man are snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them.</p>
      <p>I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.</p>
      <p>There was a little city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged it, building great siegeworks against it.</p>
      <p>But there was found in it a poor, wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that poor man.</p>
      <p>But I say that wisdom is better than might, though the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard.</p>
      <p>The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.</p>
      <p>Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="echapter10" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 10 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 10</u></h4>
      <p>Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give off a stench; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.</p>
      <p>A wise man's heart inclines him to the right, but a fool's heart to the left.</p>
      <p>Even when the fool walks on the road, he lacks sense, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.</p>
      <p>If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place, for calmness will lay great offenses to rest.</p>
      <p>There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were an error proceeding from the ruler:</p>
      <p>folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place.</p>
      <p>I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking on the ground like slaves.</p>
      <p>He who digs a pit will fall into it, and a serpent will bite him who breaks through a wall.</p>
      <p>He who quarries stones is hurt by them, and he who splits logs is endangered by them.</p>
      <p>If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge, he must use more strength, but wisdom helps one to succeed.</p>
      <p>If the serpent bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the charmer.</p>
      <p>The words of a wise man's mouth win him favor, but the lips of a fool consume him.</p>
      <p>The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is evil madness.</p>
      <p>A fool multiplies words, though no man knows what is to be, and who can tell him what will be after him?</p>
      <p>The toil of a fool wearies him, for he does not know the way to the city.</p>
      <p>Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes feast in the morning!</p>
      <p>Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of the nobility, and your princes feast at the proper time, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</p>
      <p>Through sloth the roof sinks in, and through indolence the house leaks.</p>
      <p>Bread is made for laughter, and wine gladdens life, and money answers everything.</p>
      <p>Even in your thoughts, do not curse the king, nor in your bedroom curse the rich, for a bird of the air will carry your voice, or some winged creature tell the matter.</p>

    <h6><u><i>Cast Your Bread upon the Waters</i></u></h6>
      <p>Cast your bread upon the waters, for you will find it after many days.</p>
      <p>Give a portion to seven, or even to eight, for you know not what disaster may happen on earth.</p>
      <p>If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth, and if a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.</p>
      <p>He who observes the wind will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap.</p>
      <p>As you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.</p>
      <p>In the morning sow your seed, and at evening withhold not your hand, for you do not know which will prosper, this or that, or whether both alike will be good.</p>
      <p>Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun.</p>
      <p>So if a person lives many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember that the days of darkness will be many. All that comes is vanity.</p>
      <p>Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. Walk in the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.</p>
      <p>Remove vexation from your heart, and put away pain from your body, for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.</p>

    <h6><u><i>Remember Your Creator in Your Youth</i></u></h6>
      <p>Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near of which you will say, "I have no pleasure in them";</p>
      <p>before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain,</p>
      <p>in the day when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men are bent, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those who look through the windows are dimmed,</p>
      <p>and the doors on the street are shut - when the sound of the grinding is low, and one rises up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low -</p>
      <p>they are afraid also of what is high, and terrors are in the way; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along, and desire fails, because man is going to his eternal home, and the mourners go about the streets -</p>
      <p>before the silver cord is snapped, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is shattered at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern,</p>
      <p>and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.</p>
      <p>Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; all is vanity.</p>
    <h6><u><i>Fear God and Keep His Commandments</i></u></h6>
      <p>Besides being wise, the Preacher also taught the people knowledge, weighing and studying and arranging many proverbs with great care.</p>
      <p>The Preacher sought to find words of delight, and uprightly he wrote words of truth.</p>
      <p>The words of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings; they are given by one Shepherd.</p>
      <p>My son, beware of anything beyond these. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</p>
      <p>THE END OF THE MATTER; ALL HAS BEEN HEARD. FEAR GOD AND KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS, FOR THIS IS THE WHOLE DUTY OF MAN.</p>
      <p>FOR GOD WILL BRING EVERY DEED INTO JUDGMENT, WITH EVERY SECRET THING, WHETHER GOOD OR EVIL.</p>

          <p>With a foot on water and a foot on land?</p>
          <p>Who was the angel that rode a Harley</p>
          <p>From the project to the house of Parliament</p>
          <p>And opened the book in the Devil's chamber</p>
          <p>And put the true name of the Lord in it?</p>
          <p>Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem</p>
          <p>Comes like this beast with a ball of fire</p>
          <p>They poisoned the scriptures</p>
          <p>And gave us the pictures of false messiahs</p>
          <p>It was all a lie</p>
          <p>Mystery babylon, tumbling down</p>
          <p>Satan's establishment crumbling down</p>
          <p>This is the year that I come for the crown</p>

                    <p>But I didn't stop, 'cause you was walking the opposite way</p>
                      <p>I guess I could have shouted out your name</p>
                        <p>But even if it was you, I don't know what I would say</p>
                          <p>We can sit and reminisce about the old school</p>
                            <p>Maybe share a cigarette because we both fools</p>
                              <p>Chop it up and compare perspectives</p>

                                  <p>Yes, you could tell me how hard you had it</p>
                                    <p>And you could show me all the scars to back it</p>
                                      <p>And we can analyze each complaint</p>
                                        <p>Break it down and explain these mistakes I make</p>
                                          <p>I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry</p>
                                            <p>But you knew me back when I was a younger me</p>

                                                <p>And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doing alright</p>
                  <p>Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you</p>
                    <p>Strange things my imagination might do</p>

                    <p>Took it all back if I could, I put that on my soul</p>
                      <p>And I would make a top notch good listener</p>

                            <p>I've hit a couple of snags that remind me of the past</p>
                              <p>I can't front, I'm having a blast</p>
                                <p>But d***ed if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last</p>
                                  <p>Sitting here wishing we could kick it</p>
                                    <p>Give me your opinions, I do miss the criticisms</p>
                                      <p>I didn't mean to be distant, make a visit</p>
                                        <p>I'll wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen</p>
                                          <p>But who am I jokin' with?</p>
                                            <p>There's no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it</p>
                                              <p>It doesn't matter, this is more than love</p>
                                                <p>And maybe if I'm lucky, get to see you out the corner of...</p>

                    <p>I guess I slept, it ain't like you was running</p>
                      <p>You crept out the front door slow</p>
                        <p>And I was so self-absorbed I didn't even know</p>
                          <p>And by the time I looked up, it was booked up</p>
                            <p>Put it all behind you, the bad and the good stuff</p>
                              <p>A whole house full of dreams and steps</p>

                                  <p>You disappeared, but the history is still here</p>
                                    <p>That's why I try not to cry over spilt beer</p>

                                        <p>Leaving me was probably the best thing you ever taught me</p>

                                            <p>I was a fistful, I didn't keep it simple</p>
                                              <p>Chip on the shoulder, anger in my veins</p>
                                                <p>Had so much hatred now it brings me shame</p>
                                                  <p>Never thought about the world without you</p>
                                                    <p>And I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you</p>
                                                      <p>I thought I saw you yesterday</p>
                                                        <p>But I know it wasn't you, 'cause you passed away, Dad</p>
                  <p>Looked just like you</p>

                      <p>Operator's like hold (please hold)</p>
                        <p>Man, now ain't that cold</p>
                          <p>I'm just tryin' to talk to my homie that's up in the hole</p>
                            <p>And homegirl not tryin' to be a ho</p>
                              <p>Even though she on a pole</p>
                                <p>Can she get a second chance, no</p>
                                  <p>Whoa, like the opposite of go</p>
                                    <p>That ain't how it's supposed to be - a butterfly</p>
                                      <p>But for the sake of rhymin', let's just say butterfly-ey</p>

                                      <p>I'm glad I bought these skis</p>

                                            <p>Instead of green jello and maybe chicken soup</p>
                                              <p>They fed me magazine covers and video shoots</p>
                  <p>I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me</p>

                        <p>I ain't comin' back</p>
                          <p>Be a jerk to them jerks</p>
                            <p>Yeah that'll make'em hurt</p>
                              <p>Huh, said a young boy in the mirror</p>
                                <p>A young version of me, so I started to tear up</p>
                                  <p>He said "You need to cheer up</p>
                                    <p>Your mind need to clear up</p>
                                      <p>You're already here</p>
                                        <p>Just be yourself from here up"</p>
                                          <p>Then he disappeared and I felt something familiar</p>
                                            <p>Somethin' I was taught, somethin' I had lost</p>
                                              <p>If you are afraid or fear that you gon' change some</p>
                                                <p>All you gotta do is just remember where you came from</p>
                  <p>I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me</p>
                  <p>It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be</p>
                  <p>Until I get there, 'til I get there</p>
                  <p>And yeah I got flaws</p>
                  <p>I know I'm not perfect</p>
                  <p>But all the ups and downs</p>
                  <p>Will soon be worth it</p>
                  <p>When I get there</p>
                  <p>When I get there, whoa-oa</p>

                  <p>Caught the train on the later side</p>
                    <p>Looking for a place with a little bit of life</p>
                      <p>Been a tough week, can't deny that I thought about stopping</p>
                        <p>More than once or twice, oh no, some more advice</p>
                          <p>Keep your head up while you're pushed to the side</p>
                            <p>And maybe with a bit-bit-bit more luck</p>
                              <p>You can get picked up from wherever you lie</p>
                                <p>I know, I know it's not enough, you know, you know it's hard enough</p>
                                  <p>To get a decent chance around these parts-around these parts</p>
                                    <p>I know, I know it's not enough, you know, you know it's far enough</p>
                                      <p>That you can't get there on your own anymore</p>

                    <p>But maybe it ain't good enough</p>
                      <p>Running in circles I guess, round and round, it never stops</p>

                  <p>Hailed a cab on the early side, looking for a train to get uptown</p>
                    <p>Uh, think I wanna see home, don't pick up the phone</p>
                      <p>Can't hear a sound, search our whole lives up and down</p>
                        <p>For what can't be found instead of appreciating of what we have around</p>
                          <p>Or what we have now gets tossed to the ground</p>
                            <p>I know, I know it's not enough, you know, you know it's hard enough</p>

                    <p>Then you see the light, man</p>
                    <p>Then you find the right, lane</p>

                  <p>Today seems like a good day</p>
                    <p>To burn a bridge or two</p>
                      <p>The one with old wood creaking</p>
                        <p>That would burn away right away on cue</p>
                          <p>I try to be not like that,</p>
                            <p>but some people really suck</p>
                              <p>Some people need to get the axing,</p>
                                <p>chalk it up to bad luck</p>
                  <p>I know a drugstore cowgirl</p>
                    <p>so afraid of getting bored</p>
                      <p>She's always running from something,</p>
                        <p>so many things ignored</p>
                          <p>I might do that stuff if</p>
                            <p>it didn't make me feel like s***</p>
                              <p>I'm on some old reality tip,</p>
                                <p>so many trips in it</p>
                  <p>Beautiful disaster</p>
                    <p>Flyin' down the street again</p>
                      <p>I tried to keep up</p>
                        <p>You wore me out and left me ate up</p>
                          <p>Now I wish you all the luck</p>
                            <p>You're a butterfly in the wind without a care</p>
                              <p>A pretty train crash to me and I can't care</p>
                                <p>I do, I don't, whatever</p>
                  <p>I know a drugstore cowgirl</p>
                    <p>so afraid of getting bored</p>

                            <p>but I thought it'd make a good song</p>
                              <p>There's nothing to see, shows over,</p>
                                <p>people just move along</p>
                  <p>Beautiful disaster</p>
                  <p>Flyin' down the street again</p>

                                    <p>You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent</p>
                                      <p>You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired</p>
                                        <p>Singin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it</p>

                    <h2><u><i>Til Tomorrow</i></u></h2>
                      <h6>(by David Dallas)</h6>
                        <p>Stay prepared for the up and downs, life is like a see-saw</p>
                          <p>Some say it's a b****, man, I couldn't agree more</p>
                            <p>One minute you're on top, then you're in the ER</p>
                              <p>One minute she wants you, then she wants to leave</p>
                        <p>All I can do is take the good with the bad and keep on</p>
                          <p>Gotta work hard, gotta give the fans the mean songs</p>
                            <p>Give these programmers more s*** that they can sleep on</p>
                              <p>Give these biting c**** more s*** that they can feast on</p>
                        <p>Money come and go out your life like the seasons</p>
                          <p>People do too sometimes without a reason</p>
                            <p>And it kind of seemed wrong when they took his life</p>
                              <p>Should of killed this dude, he's a f****** d*** right</p>
                        <p>And maybe get some insight from Jesus, Jehovah</p>
                          <p>Some will pray on Sunday some will spend it hungover</p>
                            <p>Whether drunk or sober, hearts is getting colder, globe is getting warmer</p>
                              <p>Maybe that's some karma for real</p>
                        <p>Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great</p>
                          <p>Things can really flip around on you in a day</p>
                            <p>But til tomorrow, til tomorrow</p>
                        <p>Pay day I'm rich, next day I'm poor</p>
                          <p>Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for</p>
                            <p>But til tomorrow, til tomorrow</p>

                        <p>Most people all talk, no action</p>
                          <p>Over that s*** and numerate it to a fraction</p>
                            <p>They be on the internet having little word wars</p>
                              <p>Typing in their 2 cents acting like it's worth more</p>
                        <p>Tell you how to surf, when they've never touched a surfboard</p>
                          <p>Dissing Tiger Woods when they're f****** even worse whores</p>
                            <p>You get the urge wanna go and call them out</p>
                              <p>Making you just as bad as them by all accounts</p>
                        <p>And what it all amounts to ain't s***</p>
                          <p>Working at a slave ship hit by the same whip</p>
                            <p>As the person that you're arguing with</p>
                              <p>While the people that you arguing about all remain rich</p>
                        <p>Say later to this try focus on your own life</p>
                          <p>Then you see Haitians with no home, no lights</p>
                            <p>Make you grateful for what you have</p>
                              <p>But got to make you wonder if you really are giving what you can</p>

                        <p>Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great</p>
                          <p>Things can really flip around on you in a day</p>
                            <p>But til tomorrow, til tomorrow</p>
                        <p>Pay day I'm rich, next day I'm poor</p>
                          <p>Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for</p>
                            <p>But til tomorrow, til tomorrow</p>
                        <p>Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great</p>
                          <p>Things can really flip around on you in a day</p>
                            <p>But til tomorrow, til tomorrow</p>
                        <p>Pay day I'm rich, next day I'm poor</p>
                          <p>Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for</p>
                            <p>But til tomorrow, til tomorrow</p>

                                <p>They work hard for a decent little cut</p>
                                  <p>Enough to let paint seep from the brush</p>
                                    <p>When I scribble I think of everybody from the lower to the middle class we might touch</p>

                        <p>They forget to get their hair cut</p>
                        <p>Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up</p>
                        <p>'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough</p>
                        <p>Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos</p>
                        <p>Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows</p>
                        <p>So say goodbye to the NAACP award</p>
                        <p>Goodbye to the India Arie Award</p>
                        <p>They'd rather give me the N-n**** Please Award</p>
                        <p>But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award</p>

                        <p>D***, here we go again</p>
                        <p>Everybody saying what's not for him</p>
                        <p>But everything I'm not made me everything I am</p>

                        <p>I know people wouldn't usually rap this</p>
                        <p>But I got the facts to back this</p>
                        <p>Just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets</p>
                        <p>Man, killing's some wack s***</p>
                        <p>Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when n***** is rappin'</p>
                        <p>Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?</p>
                        <p>He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland</p>
                        <p>I need to talk to somebody, pastor</p>
                        <p>The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay</p>
                        <p>Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay</p>
                        <p>My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say</p>
                        <p>That's enough Mr. West, please, no more today</p>

                        <p>D***, here we go again</p>
                        <p>Everybody saying what's not for him</p>
                        <p>But everything I'm not made me everything I am</p>
                        <p>D***, here we go again</p>

                        <p>I hear her speak to me</p>
                        <p>Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?</p>
                        <p>I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'</p>
                        <p>I know you're happy, cause I can see it</p>
                        <p>So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it</p>
                        <p>I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel</p>
                        <p>And look at all that he gave you</p>
                        <p>You asked for one and you got two</p>
                        <p>You know I never left you</p>
                        <p>Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you</p>
                        <p>So I can say</p>

                        <p>Hello, my only one</p>
                        <p>Just like the mornin' sun</p>
                        <p>You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name</p>
                        <p>Hello, my only one</p>
                        <p>Remember who you are</p>
                        <p>No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes</p>

                        <p>Hey, hey, hey, hey</p>
                        <p>Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day</p>
                        <p>Remember how I'd say</p>
                        <p>Hey hey one day</p>
                        <p>You'll be the man you always knew you could be</p>
                        <p>And if you knew how proud I was</p>
                        <p>You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that</p>
                        <p>And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page</p>
                        <p>I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say</p>

                        <p>Hello, my only one</p>
                        <p>Remember who you are</p>
                        <p>You got the world cause you got love in your hands</p>
                        <p>And you're still my chosen one</p>
                        <p>So can you understand? One day you'll understand</p>

                        <p>So hear me out, hear me out</p>
                        <p>I won't go, I won't go</p>

                        <p>And when you cry, I will cry</p>
                        <p>And when you smile, I will smile</p>
                        <p>And next time when I look in your eyes</p>
                        <p>We'll have wings and we'll fly</p>

                      <h6>(by ibrahim)</h6>
                        <p>He first learned the word “star” in a nursery rhyme</p>
                        <p>A verse sung to Mozart, a theme he heard every night</p>
                        <p>And when they told him to shoot for the moon, he knew he would do it.</p>
                        <p>Moving beside the planets, dancing to the tune of their music</p>

                        <p>Reading DK space encyclopedias, recesses missed</p>
                        <p>Each weekday at six, space episodes on PBS kids</p>
                        <p>He’d watch the comets fly and learned at twelve to spot Orion</p>
                        <p>Read Dawkins, Hawking, Tyson, and then moved on to rocket science</p>

                        <p>Soon traversed the universe, flew unburdened, swooped and swerved</p>
                        <p>Left behind the rules of Earth that hung aright by Jupiter</p>
                        <p>Floatin on past Oberon, every heavenly deity</p>
                        <p>Slowly drifting freely but alone towards the Pleiades</p>

                        <p>He saw the spirals of galaxies in his fingerprints</p>
                        <p>The patterns of Saturn’s rings depicted on every single tip</p>
                        <p>And gazed into the past of a perforated black canvas</p>
                        <p>Full of tiny lanterns that may already have half vanished</p>

                        <p>He was a speck of dust in the celestial ether</p>
                        <p>Left the clutches of mother earth uncertain when next he’d see her</p>
                        <p>A part of the stardust, the hardest part was losing track</p>
                        <p>Of his human past and future, consumed in the blue and black</p>

                        <p>And after so long as a cosmic message in a bottle</p>
                        <p>He wanted a shore to wash up on, a modern day Apollo</p>
                        <p>Post-Sagan, space vagrant drained from aimless astral drift</p>
                        <p>His addled brain turning asteroids to asterisks</p>

                        <p>At a loss, thoughts turned to his life before blasting off</p>
                        <p>“I just want to go home,” admitted the astronaut</p>
                        <p>And as his words reverberated across light-minutes, they found a soul</p>
                        <p>“So come home,” through the static came the sound of ground control</p>

                        <p>But when he turned around to face the void in the dark</p>
                        <p>He heard “So come home!” spoken from a voice in the stars</p>
                        <p>But when he turned around to face the void in the dark</p>
                        <p>He heard “So come home!” spoken from a voice in the stars</p>

                      <h6>(by Tame Impala)</h6>
                        <p>I was raging</p>
                        <p>It was late</p>
                        <p>In the world my demons cultivate</p>
                        <p>I felt the strangest emotion, but it wasn't hate</p>
                        <p>For once</p>

                        <p>Yes I'm changing, yes I'm gone</p>
                        <p>Yes I'm older, yes I'm moving on</p>
                        <p>And if you don't think it's a crime, you can come along</p>
                        <p>With me</p>

                        <p>Life is moving, can't you see?</p>
                        <p>There's no future left for you and me</p>
                        <p>I was hoping and I was searching endlessly</p>
                        <p>But baby, now there's nothing left that I can do</p>

                        <p>So don't be blue</p>
                        <p>There is another future waiting there for you</p>

                        <p>I saw it different, I must admit</p>
                        <p>I caught a glimpse, I'm going after it</p>
                        <p>They say people never change but that's bullshit</p>
                        <p>They do</p>

                        <p>Yes I'm changing, can't stop it now</p>
                        <p>And even if I wanted I wouldn't know how</p>
                        <p>Another version of myself I think I've found</p>
                        <p>At last</p>

                        <p>And I can't always hide away</p>
                        <p>Curse indulgence and despise the fame</p>
                        <p>There is a world out there and it's calling my name</p>

                        <p>And it's calling yours, girl, it's calling yours, too</p>
                        <p>It's calling yours, too</p>
                        <p>It's calling yours, too</p>

    <h1>Connect</h1>
    <p>If you're reading this, then it means that I love you deeply on a level that is difficult to articulate through human limitations, much less human language. I am heartbroken that I haven't the time to get to know you better. If you need anything, please get in touch and I will see what I can do.</p>
    <p>But instead of the above, how about I just say, "How you been?"</p>
    <p>Let me know how you been!</p>
    <p>My number is: (512)-409-4224</p>
    <p>My e-mail address is: baxterhoward99@gmail.com</p>
    <p>If you have something you want to say, about literally anything, know that if you let me, I will listen to you and in full. And you will be able to trust that an understanding ear is hearing any words and worries you have with care. I know it is human nature to shy away from being vulnerable, and I know there is a chasm of unknown ground between us, but my offer still stands. I am here. There is no shame or reservation in a dialogue between two true friends that seek the good will of the other.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Are you blissfully joyful? I have been there, I am there, and I will be there.</p>
    <p>Are you tragically messed up? Seriously depressed? I have been there, I am there, and I will be there.</p>
    <p>I feel that same simultaneous joy and terror for existence, that ongoing play between liberation and bondage within our boxed in souls.</p>
    <p>Wherever your heart is, I want you to know that I have been there too, that I understand, that it's okay, but it's time to get a hold of yourself and wake up tomorrow a better person, in the eyes of those who matter.</p>
    <p>What I am telling you is that there is a deep brokenness to us and our hearts and I want you to know - truly - that you are not alone when you are in the throes of the ocean, at the mercy of the waves, when you are in the jungle of the amazon, unknown danger surrounding you, when you are so heartbroken and downtrodden that you want death over life, when you are drowning in pain, when you are hurting with injustice, when you let loneliness injure you, when you feel unheard, when you screw up beyond your wildest imagination, when you feel like you are stuck at the bottom of the sea and there is no one around you in the darkness - you are not alone. I have been there, friend. And I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. You need not suffer any longer. I love you. And I want pure joy and goodness to fuel your heart forevermore. And when we have both risen from it all, if indeed your soul is covered by the truth of Jesus Christ, I cannot wait to rejoice beside you, basking in all the untapped goodness and beauty that is in you.
    </p>
    <p>"When you fail, remember that God understands our pain and suffering. He lived it. He is infinitely understanding and always willing to forgive you - just lean with all your might on His Word!"</p>
    <p>This way through the wilderness. Hurry. I love you.</p>
    <p>And if for some reason I'm not available, Our Heavenly Father is just a prayer away. I AM HERE. I AM ON YOUR SIDE. I UNDERSTAND. I FORGIVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. NOW I WANT YOU TO MAKE IT HOME SAFELY. QUICKLY NOW, THIS WAY THROUGH THE BRUSH.</p>
    <p>There was a knock at the door. It was the Lord. I opened it, uncertain of what I would find. "Behold," said the Lord. "It is I. I see you are my neighbor in this world. I happen to know there is a storm coming that will uproot every home and person that is not within my walls, and it is brewing at this very moment. I urge you with love and in love to join me at my mansion, where I have prepared a room, just for you. I want you to be there desperately, but, ultimately, the choice is yours."</p>
    <p>Oh how amazing it is to breathe with a blessed breath of life, and to begin to fully understand the bliss of every fabric of experience.</p>
    <p>Blessed be the Lord Jesus Christ. And blessed be those that seek and do reflect His character and goodness.</p>

    <h1>The Great Deception</h1>
    <p>Now I wish I had the time to present the content of this website (and this specific section) in a better way visually, but again, I must press that I am short on time. So this current section at the bottom will have to suffice.</p>
    <p>Here is the truth of our situation in this world...</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Will someone please turn the lights on in here?</p>
    <p>Would someone please turn on the lights in this world of darkness?</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Are you sure you want to know the truth about our world? Here it is, whether you believe it or not, right here below these words - the answer to why our world is the way it is.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Truly, I tell you, we have all been deceived.</p>
    <p>And it all traces back to us not listening to the Lord God.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>The world is so much more dark and so absolutely corrupt and so bathed and baked with evil that if we knew the true extent of it, we would be so utterly horrified that death would seem like a walk in the park comparatively.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Now the truth about this world is a lot to handle - so much so, that your initial reaction will likely be to one, reject it (because it is easier to believe as you have been programmed to believe), or two, minimize it (because it is easier to downplay the immense horror which has us all in chains).</p>
    <p>This is it: the current world is temporarily in the hands of Satan. Satan has many names - Satan, Lucifer, the Devil, the evil one, the father of lies. But suffice it to say that he is an angel who started and led a rebellion against God, and because of Satan's adherence to his delusion, God cast him and all who followed him down and out.</p>
    <p>Here's the kicker: there are a lot of different names for the group of people I am trying to identify before you, but a broadly-defined secular term would be "elites". There are, and always have been, a group of people who "run the world" and have <i>immense</i> power and influence over pretty much everything on earth. They control and have power over money and the flow of money, the success of individuals in entertainment and other industries, the instigation of wars across the globe, and, like you wouldn't believe, propaganda to the most sinister and hidden degree.</p>
    <p>But here is what people wouldn't believe - as you get higher and higher on the totem pole of elites, at the highest order, you have literal "Luciferians". "Lucifer" was the name of Satan before he fell. At the upper echelon of these elites, they would call themselves something to the effect of "Luciferians", because this name gives reverence to "Lucifer" who is, of course, in reality, "Satan". This is what people would not believe. People do not just gain power and influence coming from nowhere. People are offered immense power or influence or wealth or fame or all of the aforementioned because Satan gives it to them.</p>
    <p>And we know Satan has control over our world because of when Satan tempted Jesus.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p><u>Matthew 4:8-11</u></p>
    <p>Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to him, "All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me."</p>
    <p>Then Jesus said to him,</p>
    <p class=redletters>"Be gone, Satan! For it is written, "You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"</p>
    <p>Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>But if you do not believe in the veracity of the bible, may you realize that, even from afar, we all know that <i>there is <b>something wrong</b> with this world</i>. I'm telling you the truth - that something is called "the condition of sin", and we fell into it because we disobeyed God by obeying Satan.</p>
    <p>So, let us do a quick recap.</p>
    <p>#1: Satan currently holds the reigns on this beast of an earth.</p>
    <p>#2: People who exert the current greatest power and influence on the face of the earth literally worship Satan.</p>
    <p>Okay, so another name for the church of Satan is the "Occult".</p>
    <p>Occult means "hidden".
    <p>Which is what Satanists are all about - they keep their works in the dark, thinking that no one sees or hears them, and laughing at what they get away with.</p>
    <p><b>Anyone</b> who does significant research into the actual occult, and the symbols which are affiliated with the occult, the following becomes obvious - the occult is <i>everywhere</i>.</p>
    <p>LISTEN TO THIS - IT IS SO VITAL THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THIS. Essentially every form of media (pop music, movies, television, and especially all 'news' organizations) across the globe, every government of every country, every well-known corporation and company of all kinds, and most people of significant fame in the "hollywood" arena are of the occult, have ties to the occult, or, at the very least, are, for lack of a better word, slaves to the occult.</p>
    <p>For example, just look at the names of modern television shows and blockbuster films. The darkness they are deceiving us all with can even be seen in the very names and titles of the entertainment they throw at us.</p>
    <p>I swear, whoever you are reading this, once you take the time to sit back and observe all of modern entertainment, especially in the context of the values and good of Jesus Christ, and on top of everything you are able to see how the symbols of the occult (remember, this is the literal, actual, for real Lucifer-worshiping satanic church) are in so so so many corporations, organizations, forms of media, and entertainment, there is no denying that there is a serious anti-Christ agenda going on in the world. I know. It sounds crazy. I imagine you may think I'm a "conspiracy theory nutcase" now, or something. I don't care. Please do the research for yourself. Because I promise, if you take the time to actually investigate the literature of the occult, and the symbols and agendas affiliated with the occult, and you compare that information with the state of affairs in our world right now (in 2018), it's a match. Luciferians genuinely believe in the evil that they do, and because Satan is in control of this world right now, his followers are given immense power and influence and they are using it effectively on the mass population - you and me, us, regular people who don't know any better.
    </p>
    <p>But if seeing the suggestive names and titles of television shows and songs is not obvious enough for revealing their agenda to you, just look at the values that are promoted. There is a serious agenda going on with pretty much all entertainment and any form of anything that can consistently reach YOU - film, television, music, news, government, public education, and much more. And this is especially confirmed once you realize how the industries are run aka the values they have, and how everything is controlled by few and powerful companies/people. It's all a sickly sinister show, a myriad of sounds and images meant to sway the mind of the unfortunate observers, in order to genuinely accomplish the agenda of the elite, which is to rewrite history and truth and love and good and people as they see fit. And achieve greatness all on their own. And if you don't believe any of that. If the truth is too far out for you at this time, then you can at least see how this is true: even if they were not using all outlets of media for propaganda, they are surely using all outlets of media to DISTRACT you. There is an old saying and it is too true when it comes to this world we are in. "You can control the masses if you provide for them bread and circus - food and entertainment." And I don't know about you, but here in America, that's about all we are given - all across this land too many minds have fallen for the entrapments of our totally food-and-entertainment-saturated environment. Seriously. Look around you. Food and entertainment and we are theirs and they have SUCCEEDED in duping us so. They have surrounded us with food and entertainment because they want us to be dumb and ignorant and under their thumb and under their control, and they want us to idly sit by doing nothing of worth while they accomplish their quite literal devilish plan. They want to distract you from ever waking up from the cycle of vanity they have you in, finally seeing how this world is a joke because it's in the hands of tormented and delusional souls who think they will get ahead of the Lord God. And it is written they will get relatively far. But their success will not last for long at all. THIS IS ALL IN THE BIBLE - IT WOULD DO US ALL WELL TO READ AND UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH IN THE BIBLE BECAUSE WHAT IS IN THAT BOOK IS ABOUT THE ONLY REAL THING THERE IS IN THIS SINFUL WORLD. ALL ELSE IS VANITY UNTIL AT THE APPOINTED TIME THE LORD GOD SAYS ENOUGH AND POURS OUT HIS WRATH AND ESTABLISHES THE NEW KINGDOM WITH JESUS CHRIST AS THE TRUE KING, OUR RIGHTEOUS SAVIOR.
    </p>
    <p>But soon the Lord God will come in righteousness and establish actual truth in this land.</p>
    <p>PLEASE DO NOT JUST BRUSH THIS OFF AS SOME CRAZY THING NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. DO YOUR RESEARCH ON YOUR OWN - THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO ALL OF THE ABOVE.</p>
    <p>I'm just saying. If I had great global power and influence, and I wanted to trick people without them ever realizing it was a trick, then I would manipulate public perception and societal portrayal so that those that were onto the truth of the trick - "those old crazy conspiracy theorists" - as total nutcases. "Oh that's crazy, you really believe that? That's so out there, that's just not possible," is what I would want everyone to say and think toward the people actually onto something. (Truly, I tell you, this is what has been done. The truth of all of this is supported if you investigate it for yourself. For example, YouTube - which is Google - which is a company with logos containing 666 among other things - consistently takes action to demonize and diminish the work and popularity of YouTube channels which discuss and educate people on certain "conspiracy theories". And then it goes on to funnel and promote and support what is clearly occult-oriented music, secular entertainers, and other distractors that accomplish their agenda.)
    </p>

    <p>And remember, we can confirm that a lot of this darkness is happening in our world because of the <b>hidden</b> (occult) symbolism in so many aspects of global culture.</p>
    <p>If your first reaction is to deny the truth of this, then I beg you to reconsider...</p>
    <p>The bible says that Satan is the one who "deceives the whole world". That he is the "father of lies". And "the great deceiver".</p>
    <p>Don't you think that there is a chance that Satan could pull a fast one on all of us?</p>
    <p>Indeed, I tell you, he already has.</p>
    <p>I strongly encourage you to investigate all of the claims that I am making in this section yourself, because I believe the evidence points to its truth - Satan is currently in control of the world, Satan is very talented at deceiving people, and Satan uses all arms of society - government for control, media for propaganda, money for corruption, entertainment for distraction, and a lot of other things to manipulate people to do his will.</p>
    <p>And the Satanists who rule this world are all working toward one thing - a global government which will then allow one figure to swoop in and quite literally rule the entire world.</p>
    <p>What is astonishing about all of this is that the bible prophecies all of this madness.</p>
    <p>This person (or figure) which swoops in to save the day and wow all of humanity - this person will be the antichrist.</p>
    <p>Why do you think "superhero" movies are being pushed and rolled out so much in these days? No, it couldn't be programming the public's mind to accept the coming antichrist, who will perform superhero-like actions? No, surely not. Must be another coincidence.</p>
    <p>The antichrist and those with him will be granted power to perform amazing and awe-inspiring miracles and signs. These miracles and signs and the magnetic character of the antichrist <i>will deceive many into believing the antichrist</i>. As in, people will see him, the antichrist, and see his miracles, and they will believe that he, the antichrist, is God.</p>
    <p>BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE, though surely the whole world will think it is - because the whole world will be blown away by the actions that the antichrist performs.</p>
    <p>THE TRUTH IS THIS: JESUS CHRIST, THE LORD GOD OF THE HOLY BIBLE, IS THE ONE TRUE GOD</p>.
    <p>This deception that will take place has its roots in biblical history:</p>
    <p>The Lord God of the Holy Bible is the true way and the true light and the actual truth.</p>
    <p>And Satan is convinced that he, Satan, is superior to the actual truth.</p>
    <p>This is a flat-out lie.</p>
    <p>And no one has been more deceived than those who serve Lucifer. For little do they know, that the only card he has is evil, the only word he has is a lie, and the light that, a long time ago, was in him, was only there because of the will of the true light, the brighter and mightier Lord Almighty.</p>
    <p>But in order for Satan to try to experience this delusion he has, Satan tries to imitate the true Lord God.</p>
    <p>This is why the antichrist will arrive promising peace and love - and many people will like the sound of this, because true peace and true love are actually good things that are from the great and true Lord God.</p>
    <p>But what people will not understand is that the antichrist is lying to them. He is promising a <i>false</i> peace and a <i>false</i> love. But because people do not know the truth (Jesus Christ), they will fall for the antichrist and believe his many lies.</p>
    <p>This is one of the reasons why it is imperative that you come to know the truth - that you come to have a relationship with Jesus Christ. Believing in Him will set you free in so many ways. You will not be under the spells of the antichrist, or any of Satan's lies.</p>
    <p>But, alas, amazing things will happen on the face of the earth. The antichrist will receive a deadly wound to the head, and the world will mourn for him. But then, miraculously, he will come back to life. The antichrist will come back from the dead and will quickly declare himself as God. Many, many, many will be deceived.</p>
    <p>But the true Lord God will only let this abomination last for a short time, and soon Jesus Christ will return to earth and defeat the evil one and all who are aligned with the evil one with grace and ease.</p>
    <p>But until that glorious day, Satan's spells of deceit continue to work deception in the minds of everyone he can reach.</p>
    <p>FOR TRULY I TELL YOU - SATAN KNOWS THAT YOU ARE SAVED BY BELIEVING IN CHRIST. AND HE USES THIS VALUABLE INFORMATION TO HIS ADVANTAGE IN DECEPTION - HE IS EVIL AND HATES YOU. HE SINISTERLY LAYS TRAPS FOR YOUR MIND SO TO KEEP YOU DISTRACTED FROM THE TRUTH, KEEP YOU PUTTING FAITH IN WHAT ARE ACTUALLY LIES, KEEP YOU AVOIDING CHRIST AND SALVATION. IT IS HORRIBLE WHEN YOU REALIZE THE FOLLOWING - EVERY FACET OF THIS CURRENT WORLD IS TRYING TO DECEIVE YOU - TO DECREASE THE VALUE OF CHRIST, INCREASE THE VALUE OF FALSE GOOD, FALSE TRUTH, FALSE TEACHING, FALSE GODS, FALSE LOVE, FALSE PEACE, AND EVERY FALSEHOOD POSSIBLE. SATAN, TRULY THE PRINCE OF THIS CURRENT WORLD, IS SELFISH AND SELF-SERVING AND WANTS YOU TO BE THE SAME - LIKE HIM. HE WANTS TO DRAG AS MANY PEOPLE DOWN TO THE RESERVED PUNISHMENTS FOR EVIL WITH HIM AND, TRAGICALLY, IT IS KNOWN THAT HE WILL SUCCEED WITH MANY. DO NOT BE COUNTED AMONG THE MANY WHO ARE SPIRITUALLY BLIND.</p>
    <p>SIMPLY AND HONESTLY BELIEVE IN THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST AND YOU WILL BE SAVED.</p>
    <p>And such is our tragedy, the blindfold locked over our eyes - no one has the key but Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>So please, for your sake, I strongly encourage you to not just casually brush off what I have written in this section of this site. All of what I have said here is very real and the evil too awful. God tried to warn us the first time around, but we failed to listen. Do not fail to listen this time around - believe in Jesus Christ, and call upon His name, and you will be saved.</p>
    <p>The bible says everything will change in a moment...and then the time of the antichrist will usher in for seven years.</p>
    <p>DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THAT MOMENT. YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE ON EARTH WHEN THE ANTICHRIST IS REIGNING IF YOU BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST (AND YOU MUST IF YOU CARE FOR THE SALVATION OF YOUR SOUL). THOSE WHO CALL ON THE NAME OF CHRIST IN THOSE DAYS WILL BE PERSECUTED AND KILLED FOR CONFESSING JESUS CHRIST AS LORD. BELIEVE BEFORE YOU MUST DEAL WITH SUCH EVIL.</p>
    <p>The bible also says that there will be a great deception when the time of the antichrist ushers in.</p>
    <p>No one knows with absolute certainty what exactly this great deception is, but many Christ-believers are speculating that it could be a staged "alien invasion", where the antichrist or the "aliens" claim to be the creator/s of humanity, and that what will be happening next is a change in human evolution (this is why the <i>lie</i> of evolution must be propagated as true in the mainstream). Perhaps this will be the case, perhaps not. Either way, pick up a bible, and trust Jesus Christ with your life today.</p>


  <h1>Left Behind?</h1>
  <p>Has there been a sudden catastrophe where certain people disappeared? Make no mistake about what the world tells you - this is a biblical event that occurred, all foretold in the holy scripture of the bible, the book which never lies.</p>
  <p>Buckle up, because it's about to get terrible for the world, and all those that dwell in it.</p>
  <p>Deception will be rampant on the earth, and in order for your soul to conquer, you must be faithful to Jesus Christ like never before.</p>
  <p>You will be a vast minority, most likely.</p>
  <p>But fear not. In the words of Our Lord...</p>
