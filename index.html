  <p><i>Love isn't what this world teaches you it is. This world doesn't know love. This world tries to prop its own version of love but it is so far from the TRUTH, it brings death. Love isn't what you think it is. Love isn't a feeling. Love isn't comfort. Love isn't your definition of love that you happen to prefer today. No, LOVE is truth. The LOVE I'm talking about, the LOVE I'm after, the LOVE I know, the LOVE running the whole dang show - the real kind of love, the kind of love that turns you into a completely new person when you understand it kind of LOVE. The LOVE that LOVES its hateful, lost creation so much that it DIES for it and then comes to LIFE again because you can't ever kill LOVE. The only worthy, everlasting LIFE, closer than close LOVE in which all things consist, the devastatingly powerful LOVE by which all things were created - by Him AND for Him, because He <b>is</b> LOVE...No, not the false love that is preparing to deceive the lost and that the world preaches like it even knows what real LOVE is - and real LOVE is nothing short of the ALMIGHTY CREATOR of THE HEAVEN and THE EARTH, THE FIRST AND THE LAST, THE BEGINNING AND THE END, THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA, THE ETERNAL I AM...blessed and hallowed and holy be His name forever

  <p>I say this with as much love as anyone could ever have.</p>
  <p><i>If you don't remember having the following conversation with your Creator, you have the most <h1>serious</h1> case of amnesia.</i></p>
  <p>And if you don't remember why you're here...</p>
  <p><i>you're probably going to perish just like your Creator warned you.</i></p>

  <p><u>Deuteronomy 30:15-20</u></p>
  <p><b>See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;</p>
    <p>In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.</p>
    <h1>But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship otehr gods, and serve them;</h1>
    <h1>I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish,</h1>
    <p>and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.</p>
    <p>I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:</p>
    <p>That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.</p>

  <p><u>Jeremiah 6:17</u></p>
  <p><b>Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your sould. But they said, "We will not walk therein."</p>
    <p>Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, "We will not hearken."</p>
    <p>Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.</p>
    <p>Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.</p>

  <p><u>Jeremiah 7:19</u></p>
  <p><b>Do they provoke me to anger? saith the Lord: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?</p>
    <p>Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the gorund; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</p>
    <p>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.</p>
    <p>For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:</p>
    <p>But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.</p>
    <h1>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.</h1>
    <h1>Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:</h1>
    <h1>Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.</h1>
    <h1>Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.</h1>
    <p>But thou shalt say unto them,</p>
      <h1>This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.</h1>

<p><u>1 Corinthians 15:34-58</u></p>
<p><b>Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.</p>
  <p>But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</p>
  <p>Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:</p>
  <p>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:</p>
  <p>But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</p>
  <p>All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.</p>
  <p>There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.</p>
  <p>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.</p>
  <p>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</p>
  <p>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</p>
  <p>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</p>
  <p>And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.</p>
  <p>Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</p>
  <h4>The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</h4>
  <h4>As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</h4>
  <h4>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</h4>
  <h4>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</h4>
  <h3>Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</h3>
  <h3>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</h3>
  <h3>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</h3>
  <h3>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</h3>
  <h1>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</h1>
  <h4>The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</h4>
  <h2>But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</h2>
  <h2>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</h2>

<br />
<br />
<p><u>Luke 17:25</u></p>
<p><b>But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.</p>
<p>And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</p>
<p>They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</p>
<p>Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</p>
<p>But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.</p>
<p>Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</p>
<p>In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</p>
<p>Remember Lot's wife.</p>
<p>Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</p>
<p>I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one house; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</p>
<p>Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>
<p>Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>
<p>And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.</p>
</b>

<p>I had a lot to say, and I thought it of the most importance.</p>
<p>Because what I had to say shined light on how you, the reader, may have true, everlasting life according to your faith.</p>
<p>So beyond our imagination of what good is.</p>
<p>And I wanted everyone to have true, righteous, everlasting life - I still do.</p>
<p>But the real tragedy going on here is that not everybody wants that.</p>
<p>For if someone <i>actually</i> wanted the truth...</p>
<p>...then they would find it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>My poem gave glory to how you will conquer death.</p>
<p>And all who know YHUShA will soon indeed conquer death, despite disbelief on all sides.</p>
<p>It was a long love letter to all my fellow people.</p>
<p>A declaration of my love for them.</p>
<p>It was everything I could do to get them to see who I see coming so soon.</p>
<p>And so it was nothing.</p>
<p>Because they didn't want Him to come.</p>
<p>Surely - and I mean - surely - they had better things to do...</p>
<p>They didn't want to see Him in the first place.</p>
<p>So how could I have expected them to understand the implications of my words?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I walked the duty of an author - I spilled my heart's blood for the sake of the best story.</p>
<p>But I'm just a man.</p>
<p>And my blood is worthless.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I suppose our fate is sealed by what our heart wants most.</p>
<p>What we all want - surely - is the good life.</p>
<p>But if you don't know what's <i>truly</i> good...</p>
<p>And if you don't know what the <i>true</i> source of life is...</p>
<p>You're not gonna find the <i>real</i> good life.</p>
<p>So pray you don't go barking up the wrong tree, lest you die.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>All the answers you are looking for are found between the covers of the Holy Bible.</p>
<p>There you will see how the blood of your Creator was spilled for YOU.</p>
<p>There you will find how this world and everyone in it are doomed unless they get born again of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>There you will see how they weren't kidding when they said

</p>
<p>The end of days was declared from the beginning and all of it is found between those covers.</p>
<p>The same words which have the key to unlock the mystery of both you and the world you are imprisoned in.</p>
<p>The most well known book in this world...prophesies the same world's destruction.</p>
<p>If you love this world, and have anything but the truth as the center of your being, you have been terribly deceived.</p>
<p>And are in the process of being destroyed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>If you want to not go down with the ship, if you love truth, if you love what is good, if you are willing to go all in for the living YaH, then you will find YHUShA.</p>
<p>And He will save you from both yourself and this world.</p>
<p>He is always faithful.</p>
<p>He is always good.</p>
<p>He is always true.</p>
<p>He is always right.</p>
<p>He is always awesome.</p>
<p>And He will reign forever and ever.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
