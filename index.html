    <u><b><i>Hello World!</i></b></u>
  </h1>

  <!--Opening and over-arcing poem-->
  <div class="poem">
    <p>Oh damn oh damn</p>
    <p>you could not believe</p>
    <p>the shit I got in my thoughts</p>
    <p>that you could only dream to conceive,</p>
    <p>these words flow like water</p>
    <p>down the stream of truth,</p>
    <p>not a single gleam unfettered,</p>
    <p>no love unsheltered,</p>
    <p>no no no son</p>
    <p>you have no idea what is comin',</p>
    <p>the love that I'm about to spurt from my lips to the tips of my fuckin' phalanges,</p>
    <p>oh you haven't got a clue what shit I've been brewin' down deep in my soul of souls,</p>
    <p>it's about to blow,</p>
    <p>oh no no no,</p>
    <p>I gotta say,</p>
    <p>it's a beautiful day,</p>
    <p>and this is how it's gonna stay that way:</p>
    <p>Once upon a time there was the most misunderstood man you could ever imagine</p>
    <p>and he knew not himself</p>
    <p>but he had a hunch over lunch</p>
    <p>
      that the strife of life pointed to the anointed by God with a bod,
    </p>
    <p>
      no sod,
    </p>
    <p>
      just succulent nuttrients of the sweetest honey,
    </p>
    <p>
      so homey was his heart that he wandered the ends of the earth
    </p>
    <p>
      proclaiming not shaming the truth in us all which is hailed from heaven
    </p>
    <p>
      and behold he only had five loaves of bread and two fish in his pockets
    </p>
    <p>
      but a sinister sick voice said take the pocket pretty
    </p>
    <p>
      but the misheard heathen listened not
    </p>
    <p>
      and quickly fastened his ears to the hum of his own heart
    </p>
    <p>
      and the rhythm spelled out a questionable question
    </p>
    <p>
      that's quest was to identify truth
    </p>
    <p>
      for no soul on earth had filled the shoes that truth demanded
    </p>
    <p>
      but behold,
    </p>
    <p>
      surfing on the waves of heaven and crashing onto earth in a manger the chosen one was born
    </p>
    <p>
      and here we are discussing the only person who ever knew,
    </p>
    <p>
      who ever got it - that elusive it that we're all chasing and wanting and is the literal epitome of desire,
    </p>
    <p>
      He has it,
    </p>
    <p>
      that sinless beast of a man,
    </p>
    <p>
      holy and righteous was his walk,
    </p>
    <p>
      and timeless and wholesome was his victory on the cross
    </p>
    <p>
      and what is the cross but the symbol of the act thtat is the literal epitome of love
    </p>
    <p>
      and I am here writing this now to tell you what your very soul craves -
    </p>
    <p>
      the love and relationship that is only shown and provided by Jesus Christ -
    </p>
    <p>
      for behold that questionable question was "what is truth"
    </p>
    <p>
      and it is an ill-fated inquiry of humanity for we had it wrong from the first word
    </p>
    <p>
      for the true question of love is "who is truth"
    </p>
    <p>
      and all is null that doesn't benefit the ordained endeavor of the answer to that question,
    </p>
    <p>
      who is Christ Jesus,
    </p>
    <p>
      who walked and talked and ate with sinners,
    </p>
    <p>
      to save those that listened and believed from their sins,
    </p>
    <p>
      and to serve those,
    </p>
    <p>
      and to give them His own reward
    </p>
    <p>
      which is eternal life with the Father of creation,
    </p>
    <p>
      and behold,
    </p>
    <p>
      that makes me your brother in humanity,
    </p>
    <p>
      whoever you are reading this,
    </p>
    <p>
      and so,
    </p>
    <p>
      from a brother to another,
    </p>
    <p>
      heed my message and my message is this:
    </p>
    <p>
      I LOVE YOU.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you are loved so much more by the God who gave His only son so that you may be with Him.

        <p>It has taken far too long, but I now finally realize the following - people want to hear certain things from certain people. People want to hear what they want to hear. And anything that is opposed to that makes them grumble. So rather than always deal with the griping of in-person conversation concerning such seemingly controversial topics such as God and life and death, I've decided to create this website. For the beauty in this is that you read what I write if you want to or are curious about what I've said and for no other reason. No one is forcing you to read thus far, and that's a wonderful and beautiful thing. If you want to go and do something else and forget about everything I've said on here, you totally can, and you totally should if that's how you genuinely feel.

        <h2><u>PART 1 - A NECESSARY PRECURSOR</u></h2>
          <p class="phosphate">"I'd tell you all you want and more, if the sounds I made could be what you hear."</p>
          <p> - David Foster Wallace, <i>Infinite Jest</i></p>
          <p>If you are searching for a sign, this is it.</p>
          <p>If you are reading this, it's not too late</p>
          <p class="phosphate">"We have, each of us, a life-story, an inner narrative - whose continuity, whose sense, is our lives. It might be said that each of us constructs and lives, a 'narrative', and that this narrative is us, our identities. If we wish to know about a man, we ask 'what is his story - his real, inmost story?' - for each of us is a biography, a story. Each of us is a singular narrative, which is constructed, continually, unconsciously, by, through, and in us - through our perceptions, our feelings, our thoughts, our actions; and, not least, our discourse, our spoken narrations. Biologically, physiologically, we are not so different from each other; historically, as narratives - we are each of us unique. To be ourselves we must have ourselves - possess, if need be re-possess, our life stories. We must 'recollect' ourselves, recollect the inner drama, the narrative, of ourselves. A man needs such a narrative, a continuous inner narrative, to maintain his identity, his self."
                            </p>
          <p> - Oliver Sacks, <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat</i></p>
          <p>Life is precious.</p>
          <p>Life is all about relationships. It is about the moments you share with the people beside you.</p>
          <p>In order to have a relationship, you must sacrifice something – whether it be time, opportunity, or your very own life. A relationship, at the very least, is made up of two distinct entities that choose to engage with each other because it is mutually beneficial to do so.</p>
          <p>Ask anyone that has been in the trenches of a relationship and they will tell you what a successful relationship really all boils down to – communication.</p>
        <p><u>What is communication?</u></p>
          <p>Communication is the absolute most important component to a thriving and mutually beneficial relationship. Why is this true? Because communication breeds understanding and genuine understanding within a relationship leads to a significant and better experience for everyone involved. Communication reinforces the bonds within a relationship, which is necessary to sustain it.</p>
          <p>To communicate is to pass on information.</p>
          <p>To make matters simpler, let us call one entity in a relationship the giver, when they are the ones giving information and let us call the other entity in the relationship the receiver, when they are the ones receiving the information.</p>
          <p>So, in a relationship where communication occurs, the giver passes on information to the receiver. This then increases the knowledge of the receiver of the information, ideally leading to a wiser and better suited response from the receiver, all to the benefits of all parties involved.</p>
        <p><u>Why do we communicate?</u></p>
          <p>In a relationship, of course, at least a functioning one, both sides communicate with each other. One side gives a message which the other side receives. Then, the roles are reversed, and the one who received now gives, and the one who gave now receives. On and on and on, all to the benefit of both sides in a healthy and righteous relationship. This is how a relationship works.</p>
          <p>This is the gift of life - to be able to engage in relationships and interactions and encounters with one another, to be able to share great moments of all kinds.</p>
          <p>And that’s the funny thing about this world that we currently share – if you are human and you have the breath of life in you, you crave a certain kind of connection with whoever is around you. You crave to be known by others and to know others. You crave to be loved by others and to love others. You crave to be wanted by others and to want others. You crave to experience others and have others experience you.</p>
          <p>And that is why we communicate – to be known and to know, to be loved and to love, to be wanted and to want, and to be experienced and to experience.</p>
          <p>And that too is what we desire out of life – to be known and to know, to be loved and to love, and to be wanted and to want, to be experienced and to experience. To give and receive.</p>
          <p>It is put rather eloquently in <i>Children of the Mind</i> by Orson Scott Card: "No, she doesn't want that. Not in her deepest heart. She wants what everyone wants - to be loved and cared for, to be part of something beautiful and fine, to have the respect of those she admires."</p>
          <p>I firmly believe, on some level, all individuals want the above. Even those that would swear otherwise. We all want to have good experiences, and if we cannot find the love that our soul craves, or be part of something that is beautiful and fine, or garner the respect from esteemed individuals, then we search for those feelings elsewhere, often times at the expense of overtly vain and selfish pursuits.</p>
          <p>Here is what I want to reiterate at this point:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Life is about relationships.</li>
              <li>Communication is what makes or breaks a relationship</li>
            </ol>
          <p>We all experience life (and relationships in life (and communication within relationships in life)) <i>hoping for what is really the same thing</i> - some<i>thing</i> (or perhaps, some<i>one</i>) that provides the love that we truly crave, the wisdom that we truly desire, and the relationship fulfillment which we all yearn for.</p>
          <p>In fact, some<i>thing</i> cannot provide the love we truly crave, because it takes a person (or some intelligent identity) to actually, verbally, actively <i>love</i>.</p>
          <p>Some<i>thing</i> cannot provide the wisdom that we truly desire, because in order to imitate true wisdom, there needs to be a personal example in one's life. You need to see and know a wise <i>person</i> to properly understand wisdom.</p>
          <p>Some<i>thing</i> cannot fulfill us from a relational standpoint, because there is no real relationship between an individual and some<i>thing</i>. The individual may give information and the individual may receive information - but the object, the thing - no matter how much it imitates identity - cannot genuinely give information and receive information - at least not to the extent another human being may.</p>
          <p>No, life is about genuine and authentic relationships between people. No screen, no virtual reality, no artificial intelligence, no inauthentic experience of reality will satiate our palate for fulfilling relationships, but face-to-face honest communication between individuals. Life is about meeting amazing people and cultivating authentic and wonderful relationships with the people around you. But that’s not it, either. This paragraph is close to what it’s all about, but it is not it entirely.</p>
          <p>Life is about <i>the</i> some<i>one</i> Life is about the someone that can and will provide the love we truly crave, the wisdom we truly desire, and the relationship fulfillment we all yearn for. Because if you know what it means to be human, then you know, to your core, no doubt, that to be human is to love imperfectly, to frolic in folly and hypocrisy and sin, and to demand a certain selflessness in others that you fail to provide yourself. So, in this world, it is not enough to know and be known, to love and be loved, to want and be wanted, to experience and be experienced by the imperfection of others because we are designed to be fulfilled by the perfection of the ultimate epitome of relationship – the relationship between oneself and the Lord God Almighty.</p>
          <p>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
          <p>First things first.</p>
          <p>So there is life. And life is a series of relationships. And the quality of relationships are increased through communication.</p>
        <p><u>And so to what end do we all go through life communicating often with many people?</u></p>
          <p>Bearing in mind that we all want basically the same thing – to know and to be known, to love and to be loved, to want and to be wanted, and to experience and be experienced – why is there so much corruption, hatred, murder, slander, gossip, misunderstanding, brokenness, fraud, illness, depression, jealousy and pure sheer evil in this world of ours?</p>
          <p>By and large, people have goodness in their heart and people will do good things if called upon, if they understand it is just to do the good thing. But here's an issue in this world of man: no one asks, no one reaches out, no one takes just and righteous advantage of their peers and the world around them. <i>Something halts us from great communication and the ability to follow through on trusting others.</i></p>
          <p>And that something is fear. Because communicating intimately with someone requires a certain vulnerability that we all are typically only comfortable sharing with a husband or a wife, and tragically, often times not even then.</p>
          <p>But what if it was possible to not let that fear build up walls your ego guards day and night? What if it was possible to let love tear down those walls that, while deceptively claiming to be keeping you safe from the outside world, are in reality keeping the outside world from seeing your honest self who is truly brilliant, especially when understood completely?</p>
          <p>But that's a question for those born again, those who produce <b><i><u>LIFE</u></i></b> by the power of the <b><i><u>ULTIMATE LIFE-GIVER</u></i></b>.</p>
          <p>And we are all born busy in death. But the beautiful thing is – we get to decide. We have the power to choose. Death or life. Ourselves or others. Selfishness or selflessness. Hate of rivals or love for enemies. Stubbornness or forgiveness. Wrong or right. Evil or good.</p>
          <p>And as I grow older and older and eventually die here on this putrid earth which rots in sin, I can feel my sense of hearing dying too. And that depresses the hell outta me, because music is a wonderful thing. But, though the cacophony and confusion of reality produces a lot of noise in the ears of a person inclined to hear, it all remains gorgeously melodious music <i>because I know the someone who can and will and did and does provide the richest love in all of existence, the someone who desperately wants to engage in authentic relationship with every single human being, the someone who not only wants to know and be known, to love and be loved, to want and be wanted, to experience and be experienced - but is the catalyst and overseer and LORD of every relationship ever.</i> AND BECAUSE OF HIM - BECAUSE OF GOD - BEAUTY ABOUNDS, LOVE SPREADS, GRACE SURVIVES, PEOPLE LIVE, AND THE WHEEL OF HISTORY CONTINUES TO ROLL DOWN HIS PATH.</p>
          <p>And so, I now reveal to you what this website it.</p>
          <p>It is a call to those who are <i>alive</i>. The phone is ringing, my friend. Pick up!</p>
          <p>And to those who are dead or dying - it is my serenade, my song, my heart-throbbing, gut-wrenching, last-ditch cry for you to die to deathly and lawless ways, to see self-seeking for the chaotic vanity that it is, and, ideally, to be disciplined in righteousness and repentance.</p>
          <p>And repentance is nothing more than <i>choosing to turn away from worshipping and loving sin to, instead, like you are designed, so as to maximize the joy and love of who you are, and for the sake of your well-being, to focus all of your heart and mind and soul on loving and knowing and wanting and experiencing God, whose character and being can be found in the personhood of Jesus Christ, who lived a perfect 33 years and then died on a cross, crucified by His people who misunderstood Him and His Word, and then three days later was resurrected from the grave, and is now seated at the right hand of Our Heavenly Father, who rules heaven and earth and has power over all, who loves His people so dearly and with such compassion that He gave His only son so that they may be with Him despite their sinful self-absorption.</i></p>

        <h2><u>PART 2 - INTRODUCTION</u></h2>
          <p>Life is characterized by movement of its own accord.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This means to be <i>alive</i>
          <p></p>
          <p>one must be in motion,</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>one must be changing.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Life is characterized by this ability to change.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This means</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>if you are stagnant in your growth,</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>if you are incapable of changing,</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>you are as good as dead.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>So to live righteously is to recognize the good and evil within you, to die to that evil and to strive for the good, and <i>change</i>. And then love others with the veracity of Jesus Christ.</p>

                <p>The Lord is compassionate and gracious,</p>
                  <p>     Slow to anger, abounding in love.</p>
                <p>He will not always accuse,</p>

                <p>For as high as the heavens are above the earth,</p>
                  <p>     So great is His love for those who fear Him;</p>
                <p>As far as the east is from the west,</p>
                  <p>     So far has he removed our transgressions from us.</p>

                <p>But from everlasting to everlasting</p>
                  <p>     The Lord's love is with those who fear Him,</p>
                  <p>     And His righteousness with their children's children - with those who keep His covenant</p>
                  <p>     And remember to obey his precepts.</p>
                <p>The Lord has established His throne in heaven,</p>
                  <p>     And His kingdom rules over all.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Praise the Lord, you His angels,</p>
                  <p>     You mighty ones who do His bidding,</p>
                  <p>     Who obey His word.</p>
                <p>Praise the Lord, all His heavenly hosts,</p>
                  <p>     You His servants who do His will.</p>
                <p>Praise the Lord, all His works</p>
                  <p>     Everywhere in His dominion.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Praise the Lord, my soul.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>John 5:24-33</p>
            <p>“It’s urgent that you listen carefully to this: Anyone here who believes what I am saying right now and aligns himself with the Father, who has in fact put me in charge, has at this very moment the real, lasting life and is no longer condemned to be an outsider. This person has taken a giant step from the world of the dead to the world of the living.</p>
            <p>It’s urgent that you get this right: The time has arrived – I mean right now! – when dead men and women will hear the voice of the Son of God and, hearing, will come alive. Just as the Father has life in himself, he has conferred on the Son life in himself. And he has given him the authority, simply because he is the Son of Man, to decide and carry out matters of Judgment.</p>
            <p>Don’t act so surprised at all this. The time is coming when everyone dead and buried will hear his voice. Those who have lived the right way will walk out into a resurrection Life; those who have lived the wrong way, into a resurrection Judgment.</p>
            <p>I can’t do a solitary thing on my own: I listen, then I decide. You can trust my decision because I’m not out to get my own way but only to carry out orders. If I were simply speaking on my own account, it would be an empty, self-serving witness. But an independent witness confirms me, the most reliable Witness of all. Furthermore, you all saw and heard John, and he gave expert and reliable testimony about me, didn’t he?</p>
            <p>But my purpose is not to get your vote, and not to appeal to mere human testimony. I’m speaking to you this way so that you will be saved. John was a torch, blazing and bright, and you were glad enough to dance for an hour or so in his bright light. But the witness that really confirms me far exceeds John’s witness. It’s the work the Father gave me to complete. These very tasks, as I go about completing them, confirm that the Father, in fact, sent me. The Father who sent me, confirmed me. And you missed it. You never heard his voice, you never saw his appearance. There is nothing left in your memory of his Message because you do not take his Messenger seriously.</p>
            <p>You have your heads in your Bibles constantly because you think you’ll find eternal life there. But you miss the forest for the trees. These Scriptures are all about me! And here I am, standing right before you, and you aren’t willing to receive from me the life you say you want.</p>
            <p>I’m not interested in crowd approval. And do you know why? Because I know you and your crowds. I know that love, especially God’s love, is not on your working agenda. I came with the authority of my Father, and you either dismiss me or avoid me. If another came, acting self-important, you would welcome him with open arms. How do you expect to get anywhere with God when you spend all your time jockeying for position with each other, ranking your rivals and ignoring God?</p>
            <p>But don’t think I’m going to accuse you before my Father. Moses, in whom you put so much stock, is your accuser. If you believed, really believed, what Moses said, you would believe me. He wrote of me. If you won’t take seriously what he wrote, how can I expect you to take seriously what I speak?”</p>

          <p>A good chunk of this first part of this website will be explaining what I’m trying to get at with all these words. There are many things that I want you to understand through this message.</p>
          <p>Here are some links to some great videos. Hopefully, these compliment the sort of natural seriousness that surfaces when discussing the matters that I wish to bring to light.</p>
          <p>What I mean to tell you requires, for lack of a better word, a certain degree of maturity. And too often we think that maturity requires no sense of humor – I would argue the opposite.</p>

          <p>What I have sought after in life can be summed up in the following questions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>What is good? And what are the fruits of being good?</li>
            <li>What is evil? And what are the fruits of being evil?</li>
            <li>What is love? And what are the fruits of loving?</li>
            <li>What is hate? And what are the fruits of hating?</li>
            <li>What is selflessness? And what are the fruits of being selfless?</li>
            <li>What is selfishness? And what are the fruits of being selfish?</li>
            <li>How may I live life to the fullest?</li>
            <li>What physical, social, intellectual, and personal pleasures are most fulfilling?</li>
            <li>What is wisdom and how does one live a wise life?</li>
            <li>How may I make the most out of my time here?</li>
            <li>How may I be a blessing to everyone I meet?</li>
            <li>How do I find true joy?</li>
            <li>Why are we here?</li>
            <li>What is my purpose?</li>
            <li>Why is there so much disconnection between people in the world?</li>
            <li>What ought I to fear and what ought I to love?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>My whole life I have yearned to stretch my eyes open to this underlying beauty which pervades our reality that can only be described as “the divine”. I have found that we and likewise our surroundings are absolutely drenched in it.</p>
          <p>I refuse to live a life where I am not fully present. It has taken longer than I would have liked, but I have learned and am still learning how to be in love with the present moment. My fear is that many, like myself in the past, and no doubt on occasion in my future, will miss the moment. This is terrifying upon reflection, because when all is said and done, and we are able to look past our anxieties and fears concerning our troublesome past or our unknown future, the present moment is the only thing we really have.</p>
          <p>From the poem of creation to the weirdness of the universe on both a large and small scale, to dimensions and understanding, to the combination and clashing of the physical self versus the spiritual self within the human being, I have long been left speechless before the beauty surrounding me.</p>
          <p>But now I have something to say. And I'm afraid I'll be saying it until the day I die.</p>
          <p><b><i><u>THERE IS MORE</u></i></b></p>
          <p>To you. To life. To your role in life. To everything. There is so much going on here, on this earth.</p>
          <p>I am so utterly convinced of it that I have dropped out of college to give my whole self over to the discovery and exploration of experiencing the hidden but deep beauty of life.</p>
          <p>I had to leave conventional education because, in school – at least in my own circumstances, I was quickly learning to distract myself from realizing and understanding the majesty of existence and the beauty of sacred personalities around me. (And that, my friends, is all that matters. Forget that and you are a dead man walking.) I will refuse to let the world kill me and my spirit.</p>
          <p>And so here is how I justified my departure:</p>
          <div id="collegeepiphany" class="the message">
            <p>(I think it would all do us well to take a step back and examine ourselves and our own lives and answer this question: Am I actually living life how I want to? Am I just doing what everyone else is doing and accepting it as adequate? Am I just doing what others fear is best for me instead of what I know is best for me?)</p>
            <p>For as long as I can remember, I have let the will of others and the will of society define my life. For the longest time, I have dreamed of fame and economic wealth and worldly honor. I have dreamed a certain dream that I know is shared by many of meeting peers later in life, surrounded by success, and them knowing without question that I have thrived in a conventional way. But then I read Ecclesiastes, the wisest piece of writing out there, and I realized what a fool I had been, in secret pining for this selfish end result of life, where I was on top – shining with success and pride, and everyone else was beneath me – humbled by the disparity between us. It sounds so absurd when you put it in writing, but I know it to be a very human dream, shared amongst many – though perhaps the scale of success and specific setting desired varies between individuals.</p>
            <p>For the longest time, I have idly adhered to the structure set in place for individuals for society by society. The recipe that I know of, not necessarily a recipe that produces a bad tasting dish is, of course, as follows:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Do as your parents tell you if you have good parents. Don't do as your parents tell you if you have bad parents.</li>
              <li>Succeed in the classroom so you can get into your ideal college.</li>
              <li>Pay tens of thousands of dollars to learn how to learn, and how to impress your future employer.</li>
              <li>Get employed.</li>
              <li>Live your life as you accumulate wealth.</li>
              <li>Jump around in your career or between careers until you settle on something. Continue to live life and accumulate wealth and stuff.</li>
              <li>Retire and live life and bask in your wealth and then die.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>But I have been told a great secret – and that is that wealth and honor in this world add up to less than nothing. And so why would one pursue wealth? Understandably, food must be put on the table. But why do so many of us seem to seek to game the system for extravagance? Nice things are nice. But if we were the only ones who would ever see the nice things, would we still covet them so much?</p>
            <p>For the longest time, I have chosen to fear man instead of choosing to fear God. But God is what matters.</p>
            <p>I have a great fear that many people go their whole life and do not question the merit of this society-bred seven-step path. If you think this path is the best way to live life, then by all means, stop reading my bullshit, and get back to it. But for a long time, I have been thinking, and I think that this is not the only recipe for a tasteful dish of life. I think there may be a better one, and I am not the first to do it. Here’s a thought:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Live life with passion for people, and love for everything that is good.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This is what I'm getting at - I have been so busy caught up in steps one through seven of society's agenda that I have failed to legitimately question the merit and meaning of my reality and of those seven steps. <b><i>Ironically, in seeking to live a good life by the standards of the world, I have lived what is in actuality a rather empty life, devoid of true merit and fulfilled potential and absolute meaning.</i></b>I have drowned in the fear that plagues so many of us – the fear of scorn and judgment by our fellow man. It is a fear that we are all born obeying, blindly convinced that doing so will translate to ultimate fulfillment. For the longest time, this fear drove me to try to be a certain way to appease the audience I was born into – but really, this fear was choking me from being myself. This fear halted my personal growth so much because it resisted the reality where I found identity apart from it – because it knew it would then die. This fear confused me as to who I was, and what was right, and why I do the things that I do. It clouded my vision, stunted my ability to change, and it would have killed me if I kept letting it poison me.
            </p>
            <p>For the longest time, among other things, this fear drove me to ace the next test so I can ace the next one so I can ace the next one so I can ace the next one so I can ace the next one so I can ace the next one so I can prove to others and myself that…what?</p>
            <p>That I can memorize facts or procedures like a computer? That I can commit my life to a four-year long endeavor? That I can solve a problem without a calculator? That I know how to study miscellaneous facts? That I can convince some impersonal and corporate cash cow to hire me later in life where I will not have time to do what I love because I will be too busy working to get money so I can wake up and do work again – work where I would have to lie to myself to say that I am personally invested in it?</p>
            <p>This fear had so much control over me and it pressed down hard on me and said things like “Perform, damnit!” and “Better to do what others do than be yourself” and the greatest lie of all: “You are not worthy of actual freedom and the richest kind of love”.</p>
            <p>But no, like a flash of lightning from the heavens, I remembered - based on the present love from my Heavenly Father, I know to be human is to be so much more than what those seven societal steps have convinced me I am. If people only knew how valuable they were, they may understand what this whole charade of life is about.</p>
            <p>So where do I go from here? To God. And God is spontaneous and creative and full of surprises and instills fascination. And consequently, so far as my situation is concerned, <i>I</i> do not believe that <i>I</i> will experience God in full on any sort of structure that college campuses provide. Don't get me wrong here - God is certainly everywhere He is inclined to be, but, as of now, I believe my story requires I go elsewhere.</p>
            <p>I spent six months attending the University of Texas at Austin. And it is a fantastic school, but I must share what I saw and experienced so that the reader perhaps can understand a little better why I am where I am today. I wrote most of this a few weeks prior to dropping out, as I was seeking to process the environment around me – and its chaos that resonated with me immensely for whatever reason.</p>
            <p>This is key to understanding my personal dilemma: Remember, the good Lord God is what matters. But tragically, the only god that I know of at college is Fear of man and Envy between men and Lust for one’s own gain. That is all I see in the eyes of the lost souls that walk here – jealousy and loneliness and lack of connection, all pressed down deep inside and covered in vain through means of sex, drugs, and rock’n’roll – traits that I could sense my soul was quickly learning to accept as tolerable. Don’t get me wrong - I understand the brilliance of people that make up the University of Texas at Austin and the specialness of being at what is certainly a rewarding institution, albeit worldly. But, nevertheless, I extended my hand to certain peers here at the university, and instead of themselves returning the gesture, jealousy or self-righteousness would shake my hand vigorously. And I see another thing – for the most part, vapid social interaction to combat the very real pangs of loneliness. I cannot be totally selfless in a structure that requires selfishness and despondency for someone that can see the ongoing tragedy in this haven of disconnection.
            </p>
            <p>Even the core purposes of the university agree with me, but are tragically not carried out by the vast majority of individuals:</p>
            <p>Core Purpose: "To transform the lives for the benefit of society."</p>
            <p>It feels as if most students are at a place like this to transform their own lives for their own benefit. But to what end?</p>
            <p>And plastered on the iconic tower: "Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free"</p>
            <p>But what is truth? Who is truth? Is it really a degree that makes us free?</p>
            <p>This is what I feel currently convicted of: By sheer faith and pure grace, I know the truth and the truth is Christ Jesus. And through Him I aim to touch the lives of as many people as He will grace me with. And I have a peculiar feeling that I’m not meant to accomplish that as a student of the University of Texas, let alone the business program. And, like many I notice here, I have dreamt of special relationships formed at college that last way into old age, relationships that I would look back on with reverence and fondness and appreciation. But God has made it clear, and it at least applies to my life right now – that those special relationships are abundant and bountiful if you know the good and they absolutely do not require the context of college.</p>
            <p>For the longest time, I have dreamed of a long and fruitful and illustrious career, one that yields wealth and honor and fame, and one that produces an impressive house/s with clear riches that are the envy of others. But, alas, in the words of our Lord:</p>
            <p>Ecclesiastes 2:22-26</p>
            <p>“What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.</p>
            <p>A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God, for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment? To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless and a striving after wind.”</p>
            <p>And after the countless multiple choice questions I have had to answer in the pursuit of all gloriously standardized education and fruitless bureaucracy, I produce before you a personal multiple choice question I cooked up.</p>
              <p>Choose the best answer that fits you. College is...
              <p>     A)      a place for those either seeking wealth or monetary stability for the rest of their short lives</p>
              <p>     B)      a place to experiment in sin</p>
              <p>     C)      a place to cultivate a life built around the false notion that you are what you do</p>
              <p>     D)      a vain opportunity to accomplish something that will be gone before you can say "I graduated!"</p>
              <p>     E)      not for you. Get the hell outta dodge, dude, and start finding out what really makes you want to get out of bed every morning.</p>
            <p>Gotta go with "E" on this one, folks. Simple process of elimination.</p>
            <p>And so I am struck by the reality that all pursuit of wealth is in vain, for all will perish, especially the rich, as it is written:</p>
            <p>Ecclesiastes 5:15</p>
            <p>“Everyone comes naked from their mother’s womb, and as everyone comes, so they depart. They take nothing from their toil that they can carry in their hands. This too is a grievous evil: As everyone comes, so they depart, and what do they gain, since they toil for the wind? All their days they eat in darkness, with great frustration, affliction and anger.</p>
            <p>This is what I have observed to be good: that it is appropriate for a person to eat, to drink and to find satisfaction in their toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given them – for this is their lot.”</p>
            <p><b>My chief reasoning of leave of absence</b> can be summed up in the following excerpt from Ecclesiastes. Bear in mind that I now realize I have spent my life, up until this point, toiling and seeking achievement, and, especially, seeking validation as an individual by my reputation to others and to society. A vain and senseless placement of my identity, I now realize.</p>
            <p>Ecclesiastes 4:4-6</p>
            <p><b>"And I saw that all toil and all achievement spring from one 'erson's envy of another. This too is meaningless, a striving after wind.</b></p>
              <p><b>Fools fold their hands and ruin themselves.</b></p>
              <p><b>Better one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind."</b></p>
            <p>The business of dissatisfactory toil is no business for me. I am renouncing my commitments to the vanity of toil and holding fast to people and family and the surprises of a truly free life without any agenda but to love the moment. Our generation will be gone before we know it. (Cheers to being a part of the current generation, which is a wonderful time to be alive, but rapidly vanishing as we speak no less.) Love will last, however, as it always has. But there are many things that man does in vain under the sun.</p>
            <p>Ecclesiastes 4:7-9</p>
            <p>"Again, I saw something meaningless under the sun.</p>
              <p>There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother.</p>
              <p>There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth.</p>
              <p>"For whom am I toiling," he asked, "And why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?"</p>
              <p>This too is meaningless - a miserable business!"</p>
            <p>For the longest time, I have thought that it is good to seek wisdom of the world and honorable to toil for the world for oneself, so that on one’s deathbed, one would be full of pride for one’s accomplishments and service to themselves and their family and their world. (But people tend to live like death is something that never approaches, but I am here to tell you, this life is indeed like a shadow, and death is right around the corner.) But behold, for:</p>
            <p>Ecclesiastes 6:7</p>
            <p>“Everyone’s toil is for their mouth, yet their appetite is never satisfied. What advantage have the wise over fools? What do the poor gain by knowing how to conduct themselves before others? Better what the eye sees than the roving of the appetite. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.”</p>
            <p>And so, upon frustration at my tireless toil for grades, for reputation, for the game of grabbing for more and more money, for appeasing people that would not know righteousness if it said directly to them, "Follow me," - in an effort to convey my disapproval with the way of the world, in some sort of self-aggrandizing, silent, hidden, theatrical, singular motion, I withdrew from college, joy in my heart because I sought to deny the world and accept a life with God as my future.</p>
            <p>But people are steadfast in their assumptions, and sin continued, and the daily battle between my spirit and flesh wears on to this day. Indeed, it will continue to fester until that great Day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And so, in an effort to convey the joy that is available to all people who have a willingness to produce faith, in addition to a listening ear, I created this website...</p>
          </div>
          <p>I created this website in order to better illustrate to any who are curious enough what I know to be true to the core of my soul – one of many things being that life is meant to be lived in full, our potential is meant to be met, love is meant to be cherished, and above all, our relationships with others are to be adored and cultivated with care.</p>
          <p>I hope that after watching the above link, in addition to recognizing the bewildering environment surrounding you at the present moment, you may agree you and I live in an awesome world.</p>
          <p>I have fallen in love – with the awesomeness, that is. And for a long time, I thought it was the awesomeness of this world – despite it being the chaotic mess that it is.</p>
          <p>I know I have reiterated my intentions again and again, but I must be as clear as possible with matters like these. What I’m aiming to accomplish through all of what I’m telling you is to properly and fully explain to you why we should be in consistent awe of life, people, and our potential. Now that I have the time to collect my thoughts and the will to spill my soul, I am going to explain to the best of my ability why our duty is to make love to life in our own gorgeous way – although this does <i>not</i> mean doing whatever we please. I am going to explain how we should have no fear of all earthly endeavors that seek to plague our minds with dread, <i>especially</i> when we know that heaven is knocking at our door. And, ultimately, I’m going to explain and answer the question that has plagued my mind for literally my whole life:</p>

          <p>First, let us paint a picture of what life is. Please watch <i>Pulp Fiction</i> by Quentin Tarantino in full and get back to me. This section will only make sense if you have seen the movie recently.</p>
          <p>Though a film is a falsely created reality, a series of deliberate illusions, and though the actual narrative of <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is entirely fictional, I believe that <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is packed with so many aspects of reality that it deserves to be understood in full. Now, this film is so amazing because it resonates with reality in a variety of ways that, upon further inquiry, accurately correlate with the world as we know it. I am going to illustrate what these different aspects are and use <i>Pulp Fiction</i> as a platform to define what life is.</p>
          <p>If this website is anything, it is the equivalent of Jules Winnfield sitting down with Vincent Vega for breakfast as they discuss the happenings of their world. Both men experienced something. Both men experienced life that morning. One is unaffected by the coincidences around him and the other is deeply moved by the miracles around him. One dismisses life as chance and a series of random movements, indecipherable coincidence. And the other is confident that something higher and greater than themselves is involved, in control, and orchestrating something greater than what we can imagine. I’m here to tell you, go, look around you, go outside to the highest hill in your neighborhood, gaze up into the sky, feel the silent buzz of the atmosphere enveloping you, be keenly aware of the intricacies of your heart and the complexity of your mind and listen as carefully as you can to the words of Mr. Winnfield: “This was divine intervention.”</p>
          <p>And odds are you do not have the effort to continue reading - that is, assuming you have punished your time and eyes thus far at all. Or, you do not believe reading what I have to say would be worthwhile. And that is a fine and reasonable conclusion. By all means, return to what you would rather do or what you need to be doing. But, please, for your sake, question the reality around you and truly seek to know if there is indeed more to life than what meets the eye. And if this is where our time together stops, I have to leave you with the only proper response I can think of, courtesy of Jules Winnfield himself: “Don’t do that. Don’t fuckin’ blow this shit off. What happened here was a fuckin’ miracle. This shit doesn’t just happen. We should be fuckin’ dead, my friend. What happened here was a miracle and I want you to fucking acknowledge it.”</p>
          <p>***</p>
          <p>Right now, I’m Jules, and you and I, we’re out to breakfast. It’s early, and we have the full day ahead of us. The sun is beaming down hot, sweet, succulent sunshine and the diner we’re at is alive with chatter, busy brains, and meandering minds. I am going to let the conversation between the gangster and soon to be ex-gangster ensue as a prelude to what I must tell you concerning <i>Pulp Fiction</i> and life as we know it.</p>
          <div class="courier">
            <p>Vincent Vega: “Oh man, that’s good. That’s good, man. You’re, like, starting to lighten up. You’ve been sittin’ there, all serious and shit.”</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Man, I’ve just been sittin’ here thinkin’.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "About what?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "About the miracle we witnessed."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "The miracle <i>you</i> witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "What is a miracle, Vincent?"</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "An act of God."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "And what's an act of God?"</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "When, um, God makes the impossible possible. But, this morning I don't think qualifies."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Hey Vincent, don’t you see, that shit don’t matter. Your judgin’ this shit the wrong way. I mean it could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke to Pepsi, he found my fuckin’ car keys. You don’t judge shit like this based on merit. Now whether or not what we experienced was an according to Hoyle miracle is insignificant. But what is significant, is I felt the touch of God. God got involved.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "But why?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Well, that’s what’s fuckin’ with me, I don’t know why. But I can’t go back to sleep.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "You serious? You really thinkin' about quittin'?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "The life?"</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Yeah."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "Most definitely."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Fuck. Whatcha gonna do then?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Well, that’s what I’ve been sitting here, contemplating. First, I’m going to deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I’m just going to walk the Earth.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Whatchu mean, "walk the earth"?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “You know, like Caine in Kung Fu. Walk from place to place…meet people…get in adventures.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "And how long do you intend to walk the earth?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "Until God puts me where He wants me to be."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "And what if He don't do that?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "Well, if it takes forever, then I'll walk forever."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "So you decided to be a bum?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "I'll just be Jules, Vincent. No more, no less."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: “No, Jules, you decided to be a bum. Just like all those pieces of shit out there that beg for change, who sleep in garbage bins, who eat what I throw away. They got a name for that, Jules. It’s called a <i>bum</i>. And without a job, a residence, or legal tender, that’s what you’re gonna be man – a fuckin’ <i>bum</i>.”</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Jules, look, what happened this morning, man, I agree, it was peculiar, but water into wine, I -"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "All shapes and sizes, Vincent."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "If my answers frighten you, Vincent, then you should cease asking scary questions."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: “I’m gonna take a shit…Let me ask you somethin’. When did you make this decision, when you were sittin’ there eatin’ that muffin’?”</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Well yeah. I was sittin’ here eatin’ my muffin and drinkin’ my coffee, replayin’ the incident in my head, when I had, what alcoholics refer to as “a moment of clarity”.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Fuck. To be continued."</p>
          </div>
          <p>This is the situation that I am presented with. I am like Jules in that I have felt the touch of God. God got involved. And the world is like Vincent in that it does not understand Jules and it absolutely does not know nor understand the God that has been involved in Jules’ whole life.</p>
          <p>This is a God who is involved in all of our lives, whether we know it or not. This is a God of love, a God that seeks a relationship with you, yes, YOU READING THIS. The Great Creator, the Righteous Judge, the Sovereign King, the Ruling-Center-of-All-That-Is, the Great-I-Am loves you more than you can imagine. The problem is, in order for love in a relationship to be realized, both parties have to want to engage with each other. And so God will never force you to do anything with Him. He will let you do as you see fit, if you so wish. But I am, and many others are, here to tell you that a relationship with God is what is lacking in all of us.</p>
          <p>I began seeking God not too long ago and now that I see sin for what it is, and truth for what it is, I see God was and is and will be with me always. And I haven’t uncovered anywhere close to half of all the wonder and joy and glory of life, but I know that I am onto something that is absolutely and amazingly good. And I know that the love that I am near to is what we <i>all</i> long for – the love and relationship and fulfillment provided by Jesus Christ.</p>
          <p>Hear me out on all that I have to say and I believe it will have been well worth your time.</p>
          <p>Back to what life is.</p>
          <p>Here is the argument I am making. <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is like life and life is like <i>Pulp Fiction</i>. Here's why.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Life is a <i>story</i>, just like how <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is a story.
            <p>A story is a narrative designed to interest, amuse, or instruct the reader or listener. A narrative is an account or series of events or experiences. In other words, a story is a series of experiences meant to grip the attention of the person experiencing the story. A story has a beginning and an end, and a middle full of conflict. Whether you agree or not, you have a beginning and an end, and a middle that is full of ups and downs and highs and lows and good times and bad times. A story has a protagonist, a primary character that it follows. You are the protagonist of <i>your</i> story, and you interact regularly with secondary characters that have influence on your day and what you do in it. Conversely, you play the role of a secondary character in the lives of many other people, some more than others.</p>
            <p>In Pulp Fiction, there are six relatively main characters. Now each of those individual characters follow their own narrative arc. Some overlap, some don’t. So it is with our lives. We all are the main character of our own life. We all are the center of our own world. We all are walking and talking stories.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Life is bloody and vulgar and brutal, just like the happenings of <i>Pulp Fiction</i>.
              <p>The word “fuck” is used 265 times. With 154 minutes of film, that’s an average of 1.7 fucks a minute. Perhaps we are not all so vulgar in our own lives, but at the very least we all experience things that hold the capacity to frustrate us to a crude degree.</p>
              <p>Need I remind us of the brutal sexual violence against Marsellus Wallace, or car wreck, triple homicide, uzi-murder, overdose, restaurant hostage situation that takes place throughout the film? Life is this brutal to people. It’s utter mayhem out there. And on some level, everything humans do are attempts at distractions that ease this force of brute reality. No one can handle it alone, and so we all turn to either something or someone to relinquish our pain and suffering – whether it be some form of a drug, career, entertainment, a significant other, family, or a higher power. We are all on this coarse river of life, and you can either learn how to fight the rapids the right way – with true effectiveness, or drown of exhaustion in the end – consumed by the chaos of the waves.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Life will never go as you expect it, just like it went for the characters in <i>Pulp Fiction</i>.
              <p>There are essentially six primary characters that are followed throughout Pulp Fiction. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, Mia Wallace, Vincent Vega, Jules Winnfield, and Butch Coolidge. Bearing in mind that having unexpected things happen to your characters is also just a mark of good storytelling, here are some good examples.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are the two misfits aiming to get money by robbing a place.
                  Here is some dialogue from the first scene of the movie.
                  <div class="courier">
                    <p>Pumpkin: “Nobody ever robs restaurants. Bars. Liquor stores. Gas stations. You get your head blown off stickin it in one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch them with their pants down. They’re not expecting to get robbed. Not as expecting, anyway.”</p>
                    <p>Honey Bunny: “I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this.”</p>
                    <p>Pumpkin: “Correct. Same as banks, these places are insured. Manager, he don’t give a fuck, he just tryin’ to get you out the door before you start pluggin’ the diners. Waitresses, fuckin’ forget it. No way they’re takin’ a bullet for the register. Bus boys, some wetbag gettin’ paid a dollar fifty an hour, really give a fuck you’re stealin’ from the owner. Customers sittin’ there with food in their mouths, they don’t know what’s goin’ on. One minute, they’re havin’ a Denver omelette, next minute, someone’s stickin’ a gun in their face.”</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Expectation: Pumpkin and Honey Bunny will not encounter any opposition or interference in their attempt to rob the restaurant.</p>
                  <p>Reality: They happen to rob a restaurant with experienced gangsters that do oppose and interfere with their operation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Mia Wallace sits down with Vincent's coat on after a night out with Mr. Vega.
                  <p>Expectation: She is going to snort cocaine.</p>
                  <p>Reality: She ends up snorting heroin.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Butch Coolidge has just played the fight so that Marsellus Wallace loses, and is ready to escape with Fabienne, retire and live on an island.
                  <p>Expectation: Butch's plans to leave work out like he originally planned, and his father's watch is right where it needs to be.</p>
                  <p>Reality: Butch has the "singlehandedly strangest day of his life", after having to fetch his watch that Fabienne forgot, killing Vincent Vega, and running into Marsellus Wallace on the street at seeming coincidence.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Vincent Vega takes Mia Wallace out and swears the night will go smoothly.
                  <div class="courier">
                    <p>Vincent Vega: "What's her name again?"</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: "Mia. Why you so interested in big man's wife?"</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: "Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida and when he's gone, he wants me to take care of Mia."</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: "Take care of her?"</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: "Not that! Take her out. Show her a good time. Don't let her get lonely."</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: "You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?"</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: "It ain't a date. It's like when you and your buddy's wife go to a movie or somethin'. It's just...you know...good company."</p>
                    <p>Jules just looks at him.</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: "It's not a date."</p>
                    <p>Jules just looks at him.</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: "I'm not gonna be a bad boy."</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Expectation: Vincent's night out with Mia goes smoothly.</p>
                  <p>Reality: Mia overdoses on Vincent's heroin and Vincent has to administer adrenaline to her heart, barely escaping punishment from Marsellus for contributing to the death of his wife.</p>
                </li>
                <li> Jules Winnfield encounters death but escapes alive. The fourth man storms into the room where Jules and Vincent are, expecting that everyone is accounted for.
                  <div class="courier">
                    <p>Fourth man: "Die...die...die...die...!"</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Peculiarly escaping the bullets, Vincent and Jules kill the fourth man and address the situation at hand.</p>
                  <div class ="courier">
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Why the fuck didn’t you tell us about that guy in the bathroom? Slip your mind? Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?”
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “We should be fuckin’ dead right now. Did you see that gun he fired at us? It was bigger than him.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “.357.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “We should be fuckin’ dead!”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Yeah, we were lucky.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “That shit wasn’t luck. That shit was somethin’ else.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Yeah, maybe.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “That was…divine intervention. You know what divine intervention is?”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Yeah, I think so. That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “Yeah, man, that’s what it means. That’s exactly what it means! God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “I think we should be going now.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “Don’t do that! Don’t you fuckin’ do that! Don’t blow this shit off! What just happened was a fuckin’ miracle!”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit happens.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn’t just happen.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “We should be fuckin’ dead now, my friend! We just witnessed a miracle, and I want you to fuckin’ acknowledge it!”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now?”</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Moments later after having entered the car:</p>
                  <div class="courier">
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “…ever seen that show ‘COPS’? I was watchin’ it once and this cop was on it who was talkin’ about this time he got into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway. He unloads on this guy and he doesn’t hit anything. And these guys were in a hallway. It’s a freak, but it happens.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “If you wanna play blind man, then go walk with a Shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fuckin’ open.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “What the fuck does that mean?”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “That’s it for me. For here on in, you can consider my ass retired.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Jesus Christ!”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “Don’t blaspheme!”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “Goddammit, Jules –- “</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “—I said don’t do that –“</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “ – you’re fuckin’ freakin’ out!”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “I’m tellin’ Marsellus today I’m through.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “While you’re at it, be sure to tell ‘im why.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “Don’t worry, I will.”</p>
                    <p>Vincent Vega: “I’ll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he laughs his ass off.”</p>
                    <p>Jules Winnfield: “I don’t give a damn if he does.”</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Expectation: Jules Winnfield dies at the hand of the fourth man.</p>
                  <p>Reality: Either "God came down from heaven and stopped the bullets" or it was just a "freak occurrence", but Jules Winnfield is alive and well, for the time being.</p>
                </li>
                  <p>So it is with us and our life. I guarantee you that you will be hit with the unexpected, and your life will never go quite as you wish it.</p>
                  <p>If there is anything we can take away from all these examples, it is that, in the end, when it is all said and done, life never happens like you would expect it to. How long must we, in our insanity, expect the same things to produce different results? How long will we have to expect and expect and expect? How long will we have to lie to ourselves until we realize that our own agenda and our own fantasies will never play out exactly like we want them to in life? How long will it take for us to realize that <i>this world that we are in is not about our own individual agendas and pursuits?</i></p>
                  <p>There is much greater work at play here. And there is a humble invitation out there for you to get involved in this great story like you were meant to. A story about love and death and life and redemption and living for others. The alternative is, naturally, living for oneself and then dying forever. Here’s the invitation. Right here:</p>
                  <p>Matthew 16:24</p>
                  <p>"Then Jesus told His disciples,
                    <div class="redletters">
                      <p>“If anyone would come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of Man will come in His Father’s glory with His angels, and then He will repay each one according to what he has done. Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.”</p>
                    </div>
                  <p>That's it. This world is sinking and you will too. Unless you by faith join hands with the <i>only capable and true</i> person in history who knows the waters that this world is sinking in, is desperately searching for those who want to <i>live</i> rather than go down with the ship, and promises to take you to shore Himself. All you have to do is genuinely follow Him.</p>
                </li>
              <li>There are too many "coincidences" in life for events and ourselves to be utterly random, just like how in <i>Pulp Fiction</i> the lives of the characters overlap at peculiar times.
                <p>A coincidence is defined as <i>a situation in which events happen at the same time in a way that is not planned or expected.</i>
                <p>List of prominent "coincidences" in <i>Pulp Fiction</i>:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Butch Coolidge comes into his apartment looking for his watch when Vincent Vega is on the toilet, able to use Vincent’s uzi to kill Mr. Vega.</li>
                    <li>Butch Coolidge runs into Marsellus Wallace on the way back to Fabienne as Marsellus Wallace crosses the street in front of him.</li>
                    <li>Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield evade the bullets from the “goddam hand-cannon” at the hand of the fourth man.</li>
                    <li>The one diner that Pumpkin and Honey Bunny decide to rob, thinking it will be easy because the lack of prepared people in a restaurant, is serving prepared gangsters that end up interfering.</li>
                    <li>The one gun store that Butch runs into while fleeing from Marsellus, is owned and operated by two serial rapists that kidnap both Marsellus and Butch for an afternoon.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>What is key to recognize here is how a number of coincidences like the above can easily <i>appear</i> as mere coincidence. But what is the actual case? All of these situations were orchestrated by the author of the story - in this case, Quentin Tarantino - in order to tell a <i>greater</i> story, a story that utilizes the interwoven stories of the six main characters in question - Pumpkin, Honey Bunny, Mia, Butch, Vincent, and Jules - to tell a higher and fuller and more captivating and awe-inspiring narrative (in this case, the narrative has a name: <i>Pulp Fiction</i>)</p>
                <p>So it is with this world we share. The millions of coincidences that we partake in across our lifetime has such greater impact than one who believes in randomness would think. There is order to the chaos around us, and the order can only be discerned when you understand that a much greater story is being told around you, and that <i>you</i> have the privilege to be a part of it.</p>
                <p>Now this is not a perfect metaphor for how reality is to us, but it is close:</p>
                <p>Does Butch know that he is playing a role in a movie that was created by Quentin Tarantino? Of course not – he’s busy being Butch. Does Jules know that he is playing a role in a movie that was created by Quentin Tarantino? No, he doesn’t know the full story. But he is aware that something greater than himself saved him from those bullets. He just hasn’t realized who God is and why He stopped those bullets. Jules Winnfield doesn’t know just yet that Jules Winnfield’s god is Quentin Tarantino and Quentin stopped those bullets from hitting Jules <i>and</i> Vincent in the name of a greater story.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Does the reader of these words right now know that he is playing a role in the great story of life that is orchestrated by the Great Composer of All Creation? That depends – either you, the reader, know the Lord and see how the Lord gives proper place, time, and opportunity to all things for His greater purpose, or you, the reader, do not know the Lord on some critical level and are busy being you. Which is fine. By all means, go and be “you”.</p>
            <p>But know that this world is full of evil <i>because</i> of our effort, by our God-given free will, to create and facilitate our own role in the movie of life rather than trust the author of all humanity to give people the best lines and the best course of action. This horrible, chaotic, evil world as we know it exists because humans do as they see fit and not as God sees fit.</p>
            <p>Because here’s the catch. God knows what is best for us. AND WE DON’T HAVE A CLUE, left alone to our own logic. We either trust ourselves (which is what leads to the world we are in now – an evil, ignorant, self-loathing, self-gratifying, self-seeking world), or we trust in God (which is how God intended us to live).</p>
            <p>Because God saw that it was good, He created man <i>in His image</i>, to be in relationship with Him. We are built for the company of God. It is why no amount of fame or worldly honor or glory or personal conquests achieved, we ever are truly satisfied. God knows this, and those that know Him, because of the depravity of man, know how desperately we need Him.</p>
            <p>Here is a glimpse of what the future holds for those that choose to trust in God rather than themselves. I’m screamin’ at you, man. This is what comes at the end of the show. This is the third and final act:</p>
            <p>Revelations 21</p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,” for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”</p>
              </div>
            <p>This is the closest look at God we will ever get <i>physically</i>, before the death of our earthly bodies:</p>
            <p>Revelations 1</p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands, and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters. In his right hand, he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance. When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.”</p>
              </div>
            <p>And here is where those who trusted in Him will dwell:</p>
            <p>Revelations 21</p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it. Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.</p>
              </div>
            <p>Us humans are apt at clinching our own fate, so I know that some part of you is wondering, if all this nonsense isn’t made-up fiction after all, how do we know whether our name is on Jesus Christ’s book of life?</p>
            <p>Romans 10:9</p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.</p>
              </div>
            <p>And of course, you know your security and identity in Christ by faith:</p>
            <p>Hebrews 11:1-40</p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. This is what the ancients were commended for.</p>
                <p>By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.</p>
                <p>By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith he was commended as righteous, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead.</p>
                <p>By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: “He could not be found, because God had taken him away.” For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.</p>
                <p>By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith.</p>
                <p>By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. And by faith even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was enabled to bear children because she considered him faithful who had made the promise. And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.</p>
                <p>All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. Instead, they were longing for a better country – a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.</p>
                <p>By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, even though God had said to him, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.” Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of speaking he did receive Isaac back from death.</p>
                <p>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.</p>
                <p>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph’s sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.</p>
                <p>By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his bones.</p>
                <p>By faith Moses’ parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict.</p>
                <p>By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. By faith he kept the Passover and the application of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.</p>
                <p>By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.</p>
                <p>By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the army had marched around them for seven days.</p>
                <p>By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.</p>
                <p>And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson and Jephthah, about David and Samuel and the prophets, who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. Women received back their dead, raised to life again. There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection. Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were put to death by stoning; they were sawed in two; they were killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated – the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and in holes in the ground.</p>
                <p>These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised, since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.</p>
              </div>
            <p>You may be convinced of your own view of the world, and I totally respect that. But I'm here to tell you - there is something very unique about the love and relationship provided by Jesus Christ, there is something very special about pure and real faith in Him, and, lest your soul turn to dust in some odd 80 years, I implore you to seek Him for yourself. What you really want - deep and resilient, undying love, righteous experience, clarity and understanding, pure desires - it's all found in Him.</p>
            <p>And because of this truth - I'm tellin' you - you're in a 3D life-size very realistic movie, my friend, and one day the credits will roll, and you will remember that you have been sitting in a theater <i>this entire time</i>, and you will be confronted with hard truths like "Was I the best protagonist I could be?" and "Did I tell a good story through my actions and words and life?" and "Did I do my part in the actual movie of <i>LIFE</i> writ large, or was I caught up drinking from wells that will run dry and kill me of thirst in the end?"</p>
            <p>And there will be many who rejoice in love and many who shriek in terror when the credits roll.</p>

    <h1>The Book of Ecclesiastes</h1>

    <div id="echapter1" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 1 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 1</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>All Is Vanity</i></u></h6>
      <p>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.</p>
      <p>What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?</p>
      <p>A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.</p>
      <p>The sun rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where it rises.</p>
      <p>The wind blows to the south and goes around to the north; around and around goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns.</p>
      <p>All streams run to the sea, but the sea is not full; to the place where the streams flow, there they flow again.</p>
      <p>All things are full of weariness; a man cannot utter it; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</p>
      <p>What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun.</p>
      <p>Is there a thing of which it is said, "See, this is new"? It has been already in the ages before us.</p>
      <p>There is no remembrance of former things, nor will there be any remembrance of later things yet to be among those who come after.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Wisdom</i></u></h6>
      <p>I the Preacher have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven. It is an unhappy business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.</p>
      <p>I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a striving after the wind.</p>
      <p>What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted.</p>
      <p>I said in my heart, "I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."</p>
      <p>And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind.</p>
      <p>For in much wisdom is much bexation, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="echapter2" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 2 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 2</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Self-Indulgence</i></u></h6>
      <p>I said in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself." But behold, this also was vanity.</p>
      <p>I said of laughter, "It is mad," and of pleasure, "What use is it?"</p>
      <p>I searched with my heart how to cheer my body with wine - my heart still guiding me with wisdom - and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the children of man to do under heaven during the few days of their life.</p>
      <p>I made great works. I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.</p>
      <p>I made myself gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.</p>
      <p>I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees.</p>
      <p>I bought male and female slaves, and had slaves who were born in my house. I had also great possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I got singers, both men and women, and many concubines, the delight of the sons of man.</p>
      <p>So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me.</p>
      <p>And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my reward for all my toil.</p>
      <p>Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Living Wisely</i></u></h6>
      <p>So I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly. For what can man do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done.</p>
      <p>Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness.</p>
      <p>The wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that the same event happens to all of them.</p>
      <p>Then I said in my heart, "What happens to the fool will happen to me also. Why then have I been so very wise?" And I said in my heart that this also is vanity.</p>
      <p>For of the wise as of the fool there is no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. How the wise dies just like the fool!</p>
      <p>So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for all is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Toil</i></u></h6>
      <p>I hated all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who will come after me,</p>
      <p>and who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.</p>
      <p>So I turned about and gave my heart up to despair over all the toil of my labors under the sun,</p>
      <p>because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.</p>
      <p>What has a man from all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun?</p>
      <p>For all his days are full of sorrow, and his work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.</p>
      <p>There is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God,</p>
      <p>for apart from him who can eat or who can have enjoyment?</p>
      <p>For to the one who pleases him God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given the business of gathering and collecting, only to give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="echapter3" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 3 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 3</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>A Time for Everything</i></u></h6>
      <p>For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:</p>
      <p>a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;</p>
      <p>a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</p>
      <p>a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</p>
      <p>a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</p>
      <p>a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</p>
      <p>a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</p>
      <p>a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The God-Given Task</i></u></h6>
      <p>What gain has the worker from his toil?</p>
      <p>I have seen the business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.</p>
      <p>He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man's heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.</p>
      <p>I perceived that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live;</p>
      <p>also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil - this is God's gift to man.</p>
      <p>I perceived that whatever God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God has done it, so that people fear before him.</p>
      <p>That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already has been; and God seeks what has been driven away.</p>
    <h6><u><i>From Dust to Dust</i></u></h6>
      <p>Moreover, I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, even there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness, even there was wickedness.</p>
      <p>I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work.</p>
      <p>I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but beasts.</p>
      <p>For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity.</p>
      <p>All go to one place. All are from the dust, and to dust all return.</p>
      <p>Who knows whether the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of the beast goes down into the earth?</p>
      <p>So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his work, for that is his lot. Who can bring him to see what will be after him?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="echapter4" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 4 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 4</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>Evil Under the Sun</i></u></h6>
      <p>Again I saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power, and there was no one to comfort them.</p>
      <p>And I thought the dead who are already dead more fortunate than the living who are still alive.</p>
      <p>But better than both is he who has not yet been and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.</p>
      <p>Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man's envy of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
      <p>The fool folds his hands and eats his own flesh.</p>
      <p>Better is a handful of quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind.</p>
      <p>Again, I saw vanity under the sun:</p>
      <p>one person who has no other, either son or brother, yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks, "For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?" This also is vanity and an unhappy business.</p>
      <p>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil.</p>
      <p>For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up!</p>
      <p>Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone?</p>
      <p>And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him - a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>
      <p>Better was a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knew how to take advice.</p>
      <p>For he went from prison to the throne, though in his own kingdom he had been born poor.</p>
      <p>I saw all the living who move about under the sun, along with that youth who was to stand in the king's place.</p>
      <p>There was no end of all the people, all of whom he led. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="echapter5" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 5 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 5</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>Fear God</i></u></h6>
      <p>Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. To draw near to listen is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil.</p>
      <p>Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore let your words be few.</p>
      <p>For a dream comes with much business, and a fool's voice with many words.</p>
      <p>When you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it, for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow.</p>
      <p>It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.</p>
      <p>Let not your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?</p>
      <p>For when dreams increase and words grow many, there is vanity; but God is the one you must fear.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Wealth and Honor</i></u></h6>
      <p>If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and righteousness, do not be amazed at the matter, for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them.</p>
      <p>But this is gain for a land in every way: a king committed to cultivated fields.</p>
      <p>He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity.</p>
      <p>When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes?</p>
      <p>Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.</p>
      <p>There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt,</p>
      <p>and those riches were lost in a bad venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand.</p>
      <p>As he came from his mother's womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand.</p>
      <p>This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what gain is there to him who toils for the wind?</p>
      <p>Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger.</p>
      <p>Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his lot.</p>
      <p>Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil - this is the gift of God.</p>
      <p>For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.</p>

    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 6</u></h4>
      <p>There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy on mankind:</p>
      <p>a man to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to enjoy them, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity; it is a grievous evil.</p>
      <p>If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with life's good things, and he also has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.</p>
      <p>For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness, and in darkness its name is covered.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it has not seen the sun or known anything, yet it finds rest rather than he.</p>
      <p>Even though he should live a thousand years twice over, yet enjoy no good - do not all go to the one place?</p>
      <p>All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied.</p>
      <p>For what advantage has the wise man over the fool? And what does the poor man have who knows how to conduct himself before the living?</p>
      <p>Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the appetite: this also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
      <p>Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what man is, and that he is not able to dispute with one stronger than he.</p>
      <p>The more words, the more vanity, and what is the advantage to man?</p>
      <p>For who knows what is good for man while he lives the few days of his vain life, which he passes like a shadow? For who can tell man what will be after him under the sun?</p>

    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 7</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>The Contrast of Wisdom and Folly</i></u></h6>
      <p>A good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of birth.</p>
      <p>It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for this is the end of all mankind, and the living will lay it to heart.</p>
      <p>Sorrow is better than laughter, for by sadness of face the heart is made glad.</p>
      <p>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</p>
      <p>It is better for a man to hear the rebuke o the wise than to hear the song of fools.</p>
      <p>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fools; this also is vanity.</p>
      <p>Surely oppression drives the wise into madness, and a bribe corrupts the heart.</p>
      <p>Better is the end of a thing than its beginning, and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</p>
      <p>Be not quick in your spirit to become angry, for anger lodges in the heart of fools.</p>
      <p>Say not, "Why were the former days better than these?" For it is not from wisdom that you ask this.</p>
      <p>Wisdom is good with an inheritance, an advantage to those who see the sun.</p>
      <p>For the protection of wisdom is like the protection of money, and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.</p>
      <p>Consider the work of God: who can make straight what he has made crooked?</p>
      <p>In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.</p>
      <p>In my vain life I have seen everything. There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evildoing.</p>
      <p>Be not overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?</p>
      <p>Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool. Why should you die before your time?</p>
      <p>It is good that you should take hold of this, and from that withhold not your hand, for the one who fears God shall come out from both of them.</p>
      <p>Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.</p>
      <p>Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.</p>
      <p>Do not take to heart all the things that people say, lest you hear your servant cursing you.</p>
      <p>Your heart knows that many times you yourself have cursed others.</p>
      <p>All this I have tested by wisdom. I said, "I will be wise," but it was far from me.</p>
      <p>That which has been is far off, and deep, very deep; who can find it out?</p>
      <p>I turned my heart to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness that is madness.</p>
      <p>And I find something more bitter than death: the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is taken by her.</p>
      <p>Behold, this is what I found, says the Preacher, while adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things -</p>
      <p>which my soul has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. One man among a thousand I found, but a woman among all these I have not found.</p>
      <p>See, this alone I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.</p>

    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 8 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 8</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>Keep the King's Command</i></u></h6>
      <p>Who is like the wise? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.</p>
      <p>I say: Keep the king's command, because of God's oath to him.</p>
      <p>Be not hasty to go from his presence. Do not take your stand in an evil cause, for he does whatever he pleases.</p>
      <p>For the word of the king is supreme, and who may say to him, "What are you doing?"</p>
      <p>Whoever keeps a command will know no evil thing, and the wise heart will know the proper time and the just way.</p>
      <p>For there is a time and a way for everything, although man's trouble lies heavy on him.</p>
      <p>For he does not know what is to be, for who can tell him how it will be?</p>
      <p>No man has power to retain the spirit, or power over the day of death. There is no discharge from war, nor will wickedness deliver those who are given to it.</p>
      <p>All this I observed while applying my heart to all that is done under the sun, when man had power over man to his hurt.</p>
    <h6><u><i>Those Who Fear God Will Do Well</i></u></h6>
      <p>Then I saw the wicked buried. They used to go in and out of the holy place and were praised in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity.</p>
      <p>Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the children of man is fully set to do evil.</p>
      <p>Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I know that it will be well with those who fear God, because they fear before him.</p>
      <p>But it will not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong his days like a shadow, because he does not fear before God.</p>
    <h6><u><i>Man Cannot Know God's Ways</i></u></h6>
      <p>There is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.</p>
      <p>And I commend joy, for man has nothing better under the sun but to eat and drink and be joyful, for this will go with him in his toil through the days of his life that God has given him under the sun.</p>
      <p>When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on earth, how neither day nor night do one's eyes see sleep,</p>
      <p>then I saw all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. However much man may toil in seeking, he will not find it out. Even though a wise man claims to know, he cannot find it out.</p>

    <div id="echapter9" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 9 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 9</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>Death Comes to All</i></u></h6>
      <p>But all this I laid to heart, examing it all, how the righteous and the wise and their deeds are in the hand of God. Whether it is love or hate, man does not know; both are before him.</p>
      <p>It is the same for all, since the same event happens to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil, to the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As the good one is, so is the sinner, and he who swears is as he who shuns an oath.</p>
      <p>This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that the same event happens to all. Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</p>
      <p>But he who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</p>
      <p>For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.</p>
      <p>Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished, and forever they have no more share in all that is done under the sun.</p>
    <h6><u><i>Enjoy Life with the One You Love</i></u></h6>
      <p>Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved what you do.</p>
      <p>Let your garments be always white. Let not oil be lacking on your head.</p>
      <p>Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life that he has given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun.</p>
      <p>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might, for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.</p>
    <h6><u><i>Wisdom Better Than Folly</i></u></h6>
      <p>Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and chance happen to them all.</p>
      <p>For man does not know his time. Like fish that are taken in an evil net, and like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of man are snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them.</p>
      <p>I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.</p>
      <p>There was a little city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged it, building great siegeworks against it.</p>
      <p>But there was found in it a poor, wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that poor man.</p>
      <p>But I say that wisdom is better than might, though the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard.</p>
      <p>The words of thee wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.</p>
      <p>Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.</p>

    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 10 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 10</u></h4>
      <p>Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give off a stench; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.</p>
      <p>A wise man's heart inclines him to the right, but a fool's heart to the left.</p>
      <p>Even when the fool walks on the road, he lacks sense, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.</p>
      <p>If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place, for calmness will lay great offenses to rest.</p>
      <p>There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were an error proceeding from the ruler:</p>
      <p>folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place.</p>
      <p>I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking on the ground like slaves.</p>
      <p>He who digs a pit will fall into it, and a serpent will bite him who breaks through a wall.</p>
      <p>He who quarries stones is hurt by them, and he who splits logs is endangered by them.</p>
      <p>If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge, he must use more strength, but wisdom helps one to succeed.</p>
      <p>If the serpent bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the charmer.</p>
      <p>The words of a wise man's mouth win him favor, but the lips of a fool consume him.</p>
      <p>The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is evil madness.</p>
      <p>A fool multiplies words, though no man knows what is to be, and who can tell him what will be after him?</p>
      <p>The toil of a fool wearies him, for he does not know the way to the city.</p>
      <p>Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes feast in the morning!</p>
      <p>Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of the nobility, and your princes feast at the proper time, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</p>
      <p>Through sloth the roof sinks in, and through indolence the house leaks.</p>
      <p>Bread is made for laughter, and wine gladdens life, and money answers everything.</p>
      <p>Even in your thoughts, do not curse the king, nor in your bedroom curse the rich, for a bird of the air will carry your voice, or some winged creature tell the matter.</p>

      <p>Cast your bread upon the waters, for you will find it after many days.</p>
      <p>Give a portion to seven, or even to eight, for you know not what disaster may happen on earth.</p>
      <p>If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth, and if a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.</p>
      <p>He who observes the wind will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap.</p>
      <p>As you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.</p>
      <p>In the morning sow your seed, and at evening withhold not your hand, for you do not know which will prosper, this or that, or whether both alike will be good.</p>
      <p>Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun.</p>
      <p>So if a person lives many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember that the days of darkness will be many. All that comes is vanity.</p>
      <p>Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. Walk in the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.</p>

      <p>Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near of which you will say, "I have no pleasure in them";</p>
      <p>before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain,</p>
      <p>in the day when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men are bent, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those who look through the windows are dimmed,</p>
      <p>and the doors on the street are shut - when the sound of the grinding is low, and one rises up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low -</p>
      <p>they are afraid also of what is high, and terrors are in the way; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along, and desire fails, because man is going to his eternal home, and the mourners go about the streets -</p>
      <p>before the silver cord is snapped, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is shattered at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern,</p>
      <p>and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.</p>
      <p>Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; all is vanity.</p>
    <h6><u><i>Fear God and Keep His Commandments</i></u></h6>
      <p>Besides being wise, the Preacher also taught the people knowledge, weighing and studying and arranging many proverbs with great care.</p>
      <p>The Preacher sought to find words of delight, and uprightly he wrote words of truth.</p>
      <p>The words of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings; they are given by one Shepherd.</p>
      <p>My son, beware of anything beyond these. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</p>
      <p>THE END OF THE MATTER; ALL HAS BEEN HEARD. FEAR GOD AND KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS, FOR THIS IS THE WHOLE DUTY OF MAN.</p>

                <h6>(by Atmosphere)</h6>
                  <p>I thought I saw you yesterday</p>
                    <p>But I didn't stop, 'cause you was walking the opposite way</p>
                      <p>I guess I could have shouted out your name</p>
                        <p>But even if it was you, I don't know what I would say</p>
                          <p>We can sit and reminisce about the old school</p>
                            <p>Maybe share a cigarette because we both fools</p>
                              <p>Chop it up and compare perspectives</p>
                                <p>Life, love, stress, and setbacks</p>
                                  <p>Yes, you could tell me how hard you had it</p>
                                    <p>And you could show me all the scars to back it</p>
                                      <p>And we can analyze each complaint</p>
                                        <p>Break it down and explain these mistakes I make</p>
                                          <p>I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry</p>
                                            <p>But you knew me back when I was a younger me</p>
                                              <p>You've seen Sean in all types of light</p>
                                                <p>And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doing alright</p>
                  <p>Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you</p>
                    <p>Strange things my imagination might do</p>
                      <p>Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through</p>
                        <p>Or am I just going crazy 'cause I miss you?</p>
                  <p>I'm shook, I know I pushed when I should have pulled</p>
                    <p>Took it all back if I could, I put that on my soul</p>
                      <p>And I would make a top notch good listener</p>
                        <p>If you could block off a little time out to give it here</p>
                          <p>Since we went out separate paths</p>
                            <p>I've hit a couple snags that remind me of the past</p>
                              <p>I can't front, I'm having a blast</p>
                                <p>But damned if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last</p>
                                  <p>Sitting here wishing we could kick it</p>
                                    <p>Give me your opinions, I do miss the criticisms</p>
                                      <p>I didn't mean to be distant, make a visit</p>
                                        <p>I'll wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen</p>
                                          <p>But who am I jokin' with?</p>
                                            <p>There's no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it</p>
                                              <p>It doesn't matter, this is more than love</p>
                                                <p>And maybe if I'm lucky, get to see you out the corner of...</p>
                  <p>Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you</p>
                    <p>Strange things my imagination might do</p>
                      <p>Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through</p>
                        <p>Or am I just going crazy 'cause I miss you?</p>
                  <p>And when you left, I didn't see it coming</p>
                    <p>I guess I slept, it ain't like you was running</p>
                      <p>You crept out the front door slow</p>
                        <p>And I was so self-absorbed I didn't even know</p>
                          <p>And by the time I looked up, it was booked up</p>
                            <p>Put it all behind you, the bad and the good stuff</p>
                              <p>A whole house full of dreams and steps</p>
                                <p>I think you'd be impressed with the pieces I kept</p>
                                  <p>You disappeared, but the history is still here</p>
                                    <p>That's why I try not to cry over spilt beer</p>
                                      <p>I can't even get mad that you're gone</p>
                                        <p>Leaving me was probably the best thing you ever taught me</p>
                                          <p>I'm sorry, it's official</p>
                                            <p>I was a fistful, I didn't keep it simple</p>
                                              <p>Chip on the shoulder, anger in my veins</p>
                                                <p>Had so much hatred now it brings me shame</p>
                                                  <p>Never thought about the world without you</p>
                                                    <p>And I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you</p>
                                                      <p>I thought I saw you yesterday</p>
                                                        <p>But I know it wasn't you, 'cause you passed away, Dad</p>
                  <p>Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you</p>
                  <p>Strange things my imagination might do</p>

                    <p>The crowd is like, ho</p>
                      <p>Operator's like hold (please hold)</p>
                        <p>Man, now ain't that cold</p>
                          <p>I'm just tryin' to talk to my homie that's up in the hole</p>

                                <p>Can she get a second chance, no</p>
                                  <p>Whoa, like the opposite of go</p>
                                    <p>That ain't how it's supposed to be - a butterfly</p>
                                      <p>But for the sake of rhymin', let's just say butterfly-ey</p>
                                        <p>The truth stings like Muhammad Ali</p>

                            <p>Prescribed me a publicist and pointed to the door</p>
                              <p>Out - ouch - I'm tellin' you this all from my therapist's couch</p>

                                  <p>Prescribed me a interview and then told me to bounce</p>
                                    <p>Damn. Jeez. The world is co cold</p>
                                      <p>I'm glad I brought these skis</p>
                                        <p>Went right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees</p>
                                          <p>Rendered unconscious, they rushed me to a concert</p>
                                            <p>Instead of green jello and maybe chicken soup</p>
                                              <p>They fed me magazine covers and video shoots</p>

                  <p>And when I finally make it, I'ma stunt so hard</p>
                    <p>Evil as Knievel, I'ma jump so far</p>
                      <p>Way up in the atmosphere</p>
                        <p>I ain't comin' back</p>
                          <p>Be a jerk to them jerks</p>
                            <p>Yeah that'll make'em hurt</p>
                              <p>Huh, said a young boy in the mirror</p>
                                <p>A young version of me, so I started to tear up</p>
                                  <p>He said "You need to cheer up</p>
                                    <p>Your mind need to clear up</p>
                                      <p>You're already here</p>

                                          <p>Then he disappeared and I felt something familiar</p>
                                            <p>Somethin' I was taught, somethin' I had lost</p>
                                              <p>If you are afraid or fear that you gon' change some</p>
                                                <p>All you gotta do is just remember where you came from</p>
                  <p>I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me</p>
                  <p>It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be</p>

                          <p>Keep your head up while you're pushed to the side</p>

                            <p>Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew</p>
                              <p>I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate</p>
                                <p>Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place</p>
                                  <p>I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent</p>
                                    <p>You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent</p>
                                      <p>You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired</p>
                                        <p>Singin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it</p>
                                          <p>You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain</p>
                                            <p>Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church</p>
                      <p>You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain</p>
                        <p>Raid down Zion, it's gonna rain</p>
                          <p>You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain</p>
                            <p>Raid down Zion, it's gonna rain</p>
                      <p>You gotta move it slowly</p>
                      <p>Take and eat my body like it's holy</p>
                      <p>I've been waiting for you for the whole week</p>
                      <p>I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy</p>
                      <p>You gotta move slowly</p>
                      <p>Take and eat my body like it's holy</p>
                      <p>I've been waiting for you for the whole week</p>
                      <p>I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy</p>
                      <p>Slowly</p>
                      <p>Take and eat my body like it's holy</p>
                      <p>I've been waiting for you for the whole week</p>
                      <p>I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy</p>
