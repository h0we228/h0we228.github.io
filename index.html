  <!--Opening and over-arcing poem-->
  <div class="poem">
    <p>
      Oh damn oh damn
    </p>
    <p>
      you could not believe
    </p>
    <p>
      the shit I got in my thoughts
    </p>
    <p>
      that you could only dream to conceive,
    </p>
    <p>
      these words flow like water
    </p>
    <p>
      down the stream of truth,
    </p>
    <p>
      not a single gleam unfettered,
    </p>
    <p>
      no love unsheltered,
    </p>
    <p>
      no no no son
    </p>
    <p>
      you have no idea what is comin',
    </p>
    <p>
      the love that I'm about to spurt from my lips to the tips of my fuckin' phalanges,
    </p>
    <p>
      oh you haven't got a clue what shit I've been brewin' down deep in my soul of souls,
    </p>
    <p>
      it's about to blow,
    </p>
    <p>
      oh no no no,
    </p>
    <p>
      I gotta say,
    </p>
    <p>
      it's a beautiful day,
    </p>
    <p>
      and this is how it's gonna stay that way:
    </p>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there was the most misunderstood man you could ever imagine
    </p>
    <p>
      and he knew not himself
    </p>
    <p>
      but he had a hunch over lunch
    </p>
    <p>
      that the strife of life pointed to the anointed by God with a bod,
    </p>
    <p>
      no sod,
    </p>
    <p>
      just succulent nuttrients of the sweetest honey,
    </p>
    <p>
      so homey was his heart that he wandered the ends of the earth
    </p>
    <p>
      proclaiming not shaming the truth in us all which is hailed from heaven
    </p>
    <p>
      and behold he only had five loaves of bread and two fish in his pockets
    </p>
    <p>
      but a sinister sick voice said take the pocket pretty
    </p>
    <p>
      but the misheard heathen listened not
    </p>
    <p>
      and quickly fastened his ears to the hum of his own heart
    </p>
    <p>
      and the rhythm spelled out a questionable question
    </p>
    <p>
      that's quest was to identify truth
    </p>
    <p>
      for no soul on earth had filled the shoes that truth demanded
    </p>
    <p>
      but behold,
    </p>
    <p>
      surfing on the waves of heaven and crashing onto earth in a manger the chosen one was born
    </p>
    <p>
      and here we are discussing the only person who ever knew,
    </p>
    <p>
      who ever got it - that elusive it that we're all chasing and wanting and is the literal epitome of desire,
    </p>
    <p>
      He has it,
    </p>
    <p>
      that sinless beast of a man,
    </p>
    <p>
      holy and righteous was his walk,
    </p>
    <p>
      and timeless and wholesome was his victory on the cross
    </p>
    <p>
      and what is the cross but the symbol of the act thtat is the literal epitome of love
    </p>
    <p>
      and I am here writing this now to tell you what your very soul craves -
    </p>
    <p>
      the love and relationship that is only shown and provided by Jesus Christ -
    </p>
    <p>
      for behold that questionable question was "what is truth"
    </p>
    <p>
      and it is an ill-fated inquiry of humanity for we had it wrong from the first word
    </p>
    <p>
      for the true question of love is "who is truth"
    </p>
    <p>
      and all is null that doesn't benefit the ordained endeavor of the answer to that question,
    </p>
    <p>
      who is Christ Jesus,
    </p>
    <p>
      who walked and talked and ate with sinners,
    </p>
    <p>
      to save those that listened and believed from their sins,
    </p>
    <p>
      and to serve those,
    </p>
    <p>
      and to give them His own reward
    </p>
    <p>
      which is eternal life with the Father of creation,
    </p>
    <p>
      and behold,
    </p>
    <p>
      that makes me your brother in humanity,
    </p>
    <p>
      whoever you are reading this,
    </p>
    <p>
      and so,
    </p>
    <p>
      from a brother to another,
    </p>
    <p>
      heed my message and my message is this:
    </p>
    <p>
      I LOVE YOU.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you are loved so much more by the God who gave His only son so that you may be with Him.

    <h3>The Book of Ecclesiastes</h3>

    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 1 -->
    <h6><u>Ecclesiastes 1</u></h6>
      <p>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</p>
      <p>What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</p>
      <p>One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</p>
      <p>The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</p>
      <p>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</p>
      <p>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</p>
      <p>All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</p>
      <p>The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</p>
      <p>Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? It hath been already of old time, which was before us.</p>
      <p>There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.</p>
      <p>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</p>
      <p>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
      <p>That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</p>
      <p>I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
      <p>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</p>
      <p>For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</p>
