      Oh damn oh damn
    </p>
    <p>
      you could not believe
    </p>
    <p>
      the shit I got in my thoughts
    </p>
    <p>
      that you could only dream to conceive,
    </p>
    <p>
      these words flow like water
    </p>
    <p>
      down the stream of truth,
    </p>
    <p>
      not a single gleam unfettered,
    </p>
    <p>
      no love unsheltered,
    </p>
    <p>
      no no no son
    </p>
    <p>
      you have no idea what is comin',
    </p>
    <p>
      the love that I'm about to spurt from my lips to the tips of my fuckin' phalanges,
    </p>
    <p>
      oh you haven't got a clue what shit I've been brewin' down deep in my soul of souls,
    </p>
    <p>
      it's about to blow,
    </p>
    <p>
      oh no no no,
    </p>
    <p>
      I gotta say,
    </p>
    <p>
      it's a beautiful day,
    </p>
    <p>
      and this is how it's gonna stay that way:
    </p>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there was the most misunderstood man you could ever imagine
    </p>
    <p>
      and he knew not himself
    </p>
    <p>
      but he had a hunch over lunch
    </p>
    <p>
      that the strife of life pointed to the anointed by God with a bod,
    </p>
    <p>
      no sod,
    </p>
    <p>
      just succulent nuttrients of the sweetest honey,
    </p>
    <p>
      so homey was his heart that he wandered the ends of the earth
    </p>
    <p>
      proclaiming not shaming the truth in us all which is hailed from heaven
    </p>
    <p>
      and behold he only had five loaves of bread and two fish in his pockets
    </p>
    <p>
      but a sinister sick voice said take the pocket pretty
    </p>
    <p>
      but the misheard heathen listened not
    </p>
    <p>
      and quickly fastened his ears to the hum of his own heart
    </p>
    <p>
      and the rhythm spelled out a questionable question
    </p>
    <p>
      that's quest was to identify truth
    </p>
    <p>
      for no soul on earth had filled the shoes that truth demanded
    </p>
    <p>
      but behold,
    </p>
    <p>
      surfing on the waves of heaven and crashing onto earth in a manger the chosen one was born
    </p>
    <p>
      and here we are discussing the only person who ever knew,
    </p>
    <p>
      who ever got it - that elusive it that we're all chasing and wanting and is the literal epitome of desire,
    </p>
    <p>
      He has it,
    </p>
    <p>
      that sinless beast of a man,
    </p>
    <p>
      holy and righteous was his walk,
    </p>
    <p>
      and timeless and wholesome was his victory on the cross
    </p>
    <p>
      and what is the cross but the symbol of the act thtat is the literal epitome of love
    </p>
    <p>
      and I am here writing this now to tell you what your very soul craves -
    </p>
    <p>
      the love and relationship that is only shown and provided by Jesus Christ -
    </p>
    <p>
      for behold that questionable question was "what is truth"
    </p>
    <p>
      and it is an ill-fated inquiry of humanity for we had it wrong from the first word
    </p>
    <p>
      for the true question of love is "who is truth"
    </p>
    <p>
      and all is null that doesn't benefit the ordained endeavor of the answer to that question,
    </p>
    <p>
      who is Christ Jesus,
    </p>
    <p>
      who walked and talked and ate with sinners,
    </p>
    <p>
      to save those that listened and believed from their sins,
    </p>
    <p>
      and to serve those,
    </p>
    <p>
      and to give them His own reward
    </p>
    <p>
      which is eternal life with the Father of creation,
    </p>
    <p>
      and behold,
    </p>
    <p>
      that makes me your brother in humanity,
    </p>
    <p>
      whoever you are reading this,
    </p>
    <p>
      and so,
    </p>
    <p>
      from a brother to another,
    </p>
    <p>
      heed my message and my message is this:
    </p>
    <p>
      I LOVE YOU.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you are loved so much more by the God who gave His only son so that you may be with Him.
