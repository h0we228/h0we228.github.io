    <u><b><i>Hello World!</i></b></u>
  </h1>

  <!--Opening and over-arcing poem-->
  <div class="poem">
    <p>Oh damn oh damn</p>
    <p>you could not believe</p>
    <p>the shit I got in my thoughts</p>
    <p>that you could only dream to conceive,</p>
    <p>these words flow like water</p>
    <p>down the stream of truth,</p>
    <p>not a single gleam unfettered,</p>
    <p>no love unsheltered,</p>
    <p>no no no son</p>
    <p>you have no idea what is comin',</p>
    <p>the love that I'm about to spurt from my lips to the tips of my fuckin' phalanges,</p>
    <p>oh you haven't got a clue what shit I've been brewin' down deep in my soul of souls,</p>
    <p>it's about to blow,</p>
    <p>oh no no no,</p>
    <p>I gotta say,</p>
    <p>it's a beautiful day,</p>
    <p>and this is how it's gonna stay that way:</p>
    <p>Once upon a time there was the most misunderstood man you could ever imagine</p>
    <p>and he knew not himself</p>
    <p>but he had a hunch over lunch</p>
    <p>
      that the strife of life pointed to the anointed by God with a bod,
    </p>
    <p>
      no sod,
    </p>
    <p>
      just succulent nuttrients of the sweetest honey,
    </p>
    <p>
      so homey was his heart that he wandered the ends of the earth
    </p>
    <p>
      proclaiming not shaming the truth in us all which is hailed from heaven
    </p>
    <p>
      and behold he only had five loaves of bread and two fish in his pockets
    </p>
    <p>
      but a sinister sick voice said take the pocket pretty
    </p>
    <p>
      but the misheard heathen listened not
    </p>
    <p>
      and quickly fastened his ears to the hum of his own heart
    </p>
    <p>
      and the rhythm spelled out a questionable question
    </p>
    <p>
      that's quest was to identify truth
    </p>
    <p>
      for no soul on earth had filled the shoes that truth demanded
    </p>
    <p>
      but behold,
    </p>
    <p>
      surfing on the waves of heaven and crashing onto earth in a manger the chosen one was born
    </p>
    <p>
      and here we are discussing the only person who ever knew,
    </p>
    <p>
      who ever got it - that elusive it that we're all chasing and wanting and is the literal epitome of desire,
    </p>
    <p>
      He has it,
    </p>
    <p>
      that sinless beast of a man,
    </p>
    <p>
      holy and righteous was his walk,
    </p>
    <p>
      and timeless and wholesome was his victory on the cross
    </p>
    <p>
      and what is the cross but the symbol of the act thtat is the literal epitome of love
    </p>
    <p>
      and I am here writing this now to tell you what your very soul craves -
    </p>
    <p>
      the love and relationship that is only shown and provided by Jesus Christ -
    </p>
    <p>
      for behold that questionable question was "what is truth"
    </p>
    <p>
      and it is an ill-fated inquiry of humanity for we had it wrong from the first word
    </p>
    <p>
      for the true question of love is "who is truth"
    </p>
    <p>
      and all is null that doesn't benefit the ordained endeavor of the answer to that question,
    </p>
    <p>
      who is Christ Jesus,
    </p>
    <p>
      who walked and talked and ate with sinners,
    </p>
    <p>
      to save those that listened and believed from their sins,
    </p>
    <p>
      and to serve those,
    </p>
    <p>
      and to give them His own reward
    </p>
    <p>
      which is eternal life with the Father of creation,
    </p>
    <p>
      and behold,
    </p>
    <p>
      that makes me your brother in humanity,
    </p>
    <p>
      whoever you are reading this,
    </p>
    <p>
      and so,
    </p>
    <p>
      from a brother to another,
    </p>
    <p>
      heed my message and my message is this:
    </p>
    <p>
      I LOVE YOU.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you are loved so much more by the God who gave His only son so that you may be with Him.

    <h1>The Book of Ecclesiastes</h1>

    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 1 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 1</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>All Is Vanity</i></u></h6>
      <p>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.</p>
      <p>What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?</p>
      <p>A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.</p>
      <p>The sun rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where it rises.</p>
      <p>TThe wind blows to the south and goes around to the north; around and around goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns.</p>
      <p>All streams run to the sea, but the sea is not full; to the place where the streams flow, there they flow again.</p>
      <p>All things are full of weariness; a man cannot utter it; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</p>
      <p>What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun.</p>
      <p>Is there a thing of which it is said, "See, this is new"? It has been already in the ages before us.</p>
      <p>There is no remembrance of former things, nor will there be any remembrance of later things yet to be among those who come after.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Wisdom</i></u></h6>
      <p>I the Preacher have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven. It is an unhappy business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.</p>
      <p>I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a striving after the wind.</p>
      <p>What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted.</p>
      <p>I said in my heart, "I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."</p>
      <p>And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind.</p>
      <p>For in much wisdom is much bexation, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</p>
