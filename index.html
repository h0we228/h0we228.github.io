    <p>Life. Death. The burden of the artist is to
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRl4-CKtSzI" target="_blank"><b>capture</b>.</a></p>
    <p>Listen:</p>
    <p>Very soon the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords - the true Lord of all creation whose name we know now as Jesus Christ - is going to return for His people.</p>
    <p>This is real. This is happening. Not only is this biblical truth going to manifest in reality in our lifetime, <b>it is going to happen so much sooner than you think</b>. <i>The signs are <b>everywhere</b>.</i></p>
    <p>And you must be lucky or something, because as of this writing, it is within your power to choose the truth and be saved.</p>
    <p>Those with the eyes to see and the ears to hear are seeing and hearing oh so much. The Spirit of the Lord is working beautifully in 2018.</p>
    <p>Much of creation is yearning for the truth to return, expose, and destroy the darkness, as it is written.</p>
    <p>Very soon the Lord will expose the darkness with His glorious light - praise God, for the darkness is devastatingly deep but it cannot overcome His light.</p>
    <p>Very soon the Lord will expose the darkness which has covered the minds of those who put their faith in their own works and false gods and false doctrines.</p>
    <p>We have all been caught in a horrible trap - the world as we know it.</p>
    <p>I cannot stress this enough:</p>
    <p>The world is a trap for each of us since birth, a marvelous snare in the business of trickery and falsehood.</p>
    <p>But behold, THE LORD GOD HAS SET THOSE FREE THAT ARE IN CHRIST.</p>
    <p>Please turn to Jesus Christ! The time is quickly approaching when His wrath will be felt across the face of the earth, and many who do not know and believe the truth will be led astray.</p>
    <p>Truly, I tell you, from birth the world has us believing lies like you would not imagine.</p>
    <p>And for a short time, the lies are going to get even greater and more sinister, and the consequences of actions during this short time will be like they are now - eternal.</p>
    <p>HOLD FAST TO THE TRUTH - HOLD FAST TO JESUS CHRIST - THE JESUS CHRIST OF THE HOLY BIBLE.</p>
    <p>I cannot stress this enough:</p>
    <p>Please, please, please wake up to the vanity that you and me and the whole world is drenched in - a frivolous game toward death.</p>
    <p>Please slow down on the wheel that society gives you to run in vain on. Step out of the made-up race for a second, and honestly ask some real questions, the answers to which actually matter:</p>
    <p>..."What on earth are you doing here?...</p>
    <p>...And why are you kept too busy to thoroughly question the nature of your reality?...</p>
    <p>...<i>Why does a society which does not know the answer to why it exists expect you to perform a certain way?</i>...</p>
    <p>...Why do the politicians and "leaders" of every country, and especially the United States, <i>never get anything of lasting significance done</i> and, especially recently <i>promote nothing but divisive issues</i>? Don't you think that if people with legitimate amounts of power and money <b>really</b> wanted to help the world, then they could accomplish more than what they report doing?...</p>
    <p>...Why is there a clear correlation between current political issues and what is on Netflix? Why is there always a correlation between the content of heavily pushed and advertized films and television and politics?</p>
    <p>...You have to ask yourself, once the glass breaks, and your mind sees the patterns all around you: "WHY IS THERE SUCH A CLEAR CONNECTION BETWEEN <b>GOVERNMENT, ENTERTAINMENT,</b> and <b>EDUCATION</b>? WHY DO THOSE THREE FACETS OF LIFE HAVE SO MUCH INFLUENCE ON OUR MIND AND LIVELIHOOD? AND WHY, WHEN YOU STEP OUT OF THE FABRICATED RACE THEY MADE UP FOR US TO RUN, DO YOU SEE HOW THEY ARE ALL ARMS OF THE SAME MALICIOUS MIND, ALL FINGERS OF THE SAME EVIL HAND WHICH DOES ITS BEST TO BLIND ANYONE WHO IS BORN UNDER ITS SHADOW? <b>WHO CONTROLS GOVERNMENT <i>REALLY</i>? WHO CONTROLS ENTERTAINMENT <i>REALLY</i>? WHO CONTROLS "EDUCATION" <i>REALLY</i>?</b> And why in God's good name, would the crux of the message of the world be: <i>Conform to us. Follow us. Believe in what we tell you is the truth. Do not question us. We will tell you what to think. All you need to do is follow the law we created, go to the school whose curriculum we fully control, think you have freedom in choosing some career which we also regulate and moderate, and then when you go home - when you are exhausted from a day's labor doing what we have forced you to do in vain, you can turn on the television where we provide the themes and messages of all popular entertainment or go online or on your phone where there is nothing much but distraction and vanity but we'll invent virtual and invisible likes and upvotes and buttons and games, empty of significance, but we'll get you to love it anyway, and then the highlight of your day can be seeing your children excel in school which little do you know is subtle and sinister indoctrination of so much falsehood and vainglory and knowledge of no value EXCEPT
      <b>in getting you to think that you are the god of your own life and believing the knowledge you learn in the fabricated system is worthy of your time and effort only because it helps you progress further into our system of control, which indeed and truly does blind the whole world to our simultaneous evil devices."</b></p>
    <p>...And why are we all taught not to ask these questions? Or at least to not spend too much time on them?"...</p>
    <p>I believe because then you would start waking up, so to speak. You would begin to see the hidden chains of slavery the world has its inhabitants in. But someone in control of the world wants you ignorant and asleep. Why is that? Why would some force in the world want you caught up in a lie?</p>
    <p>VERY SOON THERE WILL BE SEEMINGLY UNBELIEVABLE THINGS HAPPENING ACROSS THE FACE OF THE EARTH.</p>
    <p>I cannot stress this enough:</p>
    <p>Do not trust what the world tells you to trust - the world - and at its head, Satan - are out to mislead and destroy your soul.</p>
    <p>Satan is going to come and deceive many and claim he is God. This is a lie and a great evil.</p>
    <p>Be sure your heart is in the right place - with the true Lord of life - Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>The literal devil - yes, he is real; you have bought a lie from the world if you think he is fiction - will claim that all religions are equally viable. He will deceive the world and unite the world into following a one world religion, a one world "spirituality". Many will believe this lie. Many already have been deceived into thinking that truth is not exclusive to one path...But, by definition, truth <b>must</b> be exclusive. By pure reason, sheer logic, by definition, there is one truth. Many lies, but one truth.</p>
    <p>And that one truth is Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>Remember this:</p>
    <p>Satan wants you to not believe in the truth (Jesus Christ) and Satan runs current society - and what does current society do? It diminishes and disregards the authority and truth of Christ and it promotes Satanic, self-serving, self-worshipping, falsehood.</p>
    <p>I know me just saying this is a fact won't make a difference as to whether you believe me or not, but it is still worth saying...the following is a fact:</p>
    <p>The world is tricking you, if you are not in Christ Jesus. The world is trying very hard to get you to not believe in Jesus Christ and what He did for you and how much He loves you.</p>
    <p>Why is this the agenda of the world? Because Satan and the world know that if you believe in Christ, you are saved. But Satan hates you, and so he lies to you, and really tries to control your mind into disregarding Jesus and the validity of the bible.</p>
    <p>THIS IS SERIOUS. I'M NOT KIDDING AROUND. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. IF PEOPLE HAVE MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED RECENTLY, SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY.</p>
    <p>Get busy trusting in Jesus Christ, the anointed salvation for literally <b><i>anyone who believes in Him.</i></b> That's the cutoff. Do you believe Him? Do you trust Him with your life instead of what the world tries to convince you to trust in?</p>
    <p>PLEASE READ <b><i>ALL</i></b> OF WHAT I HAVE TO SAY BELOW, BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING - MAKE JESUS CHRIST YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE - PLEASE, FOR YOUR SAKE.</p>
    <p>GET TO KNOW JESUS CHRIST ON A PERSONAL LEVEL. IT IS NOT ABOUT RELIGION...IT IS ABOUT RELATIONSHIP. AND THE ONLY RELATIONSHIP WHICH TRULY MATTERS IS THAT BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER - AND JESUS HAS REVEALED THE TRUTH - THAT JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY TO THE HEAVENLY FATHER, THE TRUE LORD OF ALL CREATION.</p>
    <p>IF YOU KNOW JESUS CHRIST, THEN YOU KNOW THE LORD GOD. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW JESUS CHRIST, THEN YOU DO NOT KNOW THE LORD GOD.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p><b>YOU ARE IN A SYSTEM OF CONTROL. A CLEVERLY DESIGNED SATANIC SYSTEM WHICH DOES ITS BEST TO DISTRACT YOU WITH MEANINGLESS PURSUITS AND VAINGLORY, AND TO DECEIVE YOU INTO LOVING LIES, INTO LOVING ANYTHING BUT THE TRUTH. WE WERE ALL BORN INTO IT. YOU ARE BLIND IF YOU DO NOT SEE IT.</b></p>
    <p>The depth and breadth of the propaganda against Jesus Christ and His truth would astound you. So many lies, it is truly sickening. But, alas, a mountain of lies is the only tool Satan has in his attempt to hide the world from the truth...But you can't hide the truth if the truth wants to reveal itself - and it did through Jesus Christ!</p>
    <p>But the propaganda in this world is real and pervasive. They mock the masses (you and me) right in front of us. They hide in plain sight. Television is their playground. They know how to manipulate the masses (you and me) at the subconscious level.</p>
    <p>You begin to see how deep the deception goes when you understand their symbolism and notice the clear-once-revealed agenda. And then the obvious conclusions follow:</p>
    <p>Why would those in charge of what is clearly an evil world have an agenda against this guy which has stuck around named Jesus Christ?</p>
    <p>Why would the heads of literally all world religions be promoting "unity" when the bible clearly foretells that the anti-Christ world system will only promote unity for malicious and tyrannical ends?</p>
    <p>Why would the people who print our money care so much about dismantling the true church of Jesus Christ, making Christianity seem complex or gnostic or esoteric, inventing divisions and sects of the church - many of which preach false gospels, in addition to continually skewing the public view of "Christians" as more and more hateful?</p>
    <p>And the delusion even extends to this - "Why is the name of Jesus used and propagated as something to say when you swear, when no other supposed spiritual leader of the old world or new world is used in such vain?" It's subtle, but it is another jab and misdirection from the enemy.
    <p>Here's why:</p>
    <p>Because Jesus Christ <i>is</i> God.</p>
    <p>Truly, I tell you, there will come a day when this world will literally <i>behead</i> anyone who claims Christ as God.</p>
    <p>That is how much the Master of Lies, Satan, hates the truth. And the Father of Lies hates you, too! He <i>only</i> cares about himself and gaining his own glory, and he wants you to be the same! Satan is imprisoned and blinded by his own hatred of the truth, and so he propagates lies, and if it wasn't for the hand of the Lord God (Jesus Christ) in the way of things, Satan would torture you to death and then spit on your grave. Don't fall for his lies which only seek to mislead people from the truth!</p>
    <p>Come to Jesus before you must suffer such evil. This evil is coming, I promise you. Recently, a woman was imprisoned for baptizing her own child. This is just the beginning.</p>
    <p>Because if your faith is weak in those evil days, and you give into the ways of the world which will surely be enticing, and you deny Jesus Christ at the world's request, it will cost you eternity.</p>
    <p>WHY ARE YOU EVEN INTERESTED IN CONFORMING TO THE WAYS OF THIS WORLD?</p>
    <p>DON'T YOU THINK OUT OF SEVEN BILLION PLUS PEOPLE, THERE COULD BE SOME SENSIBLE AND EFFICIENT LEADERSHIP ON THIS PLANET?</p>
    <p>BUT THERE IS NOT, BECAUSE THIS WORLD IS CORRUPT, THE MIND BEHIND ALL OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD IS CORRUPT, AND IT WAS CORRUPTED A LONG TIME AGO.</p>
    <p><b>Why would you obey a corrupt system? Why would you listen to what a corrupt system tells you to do?</b></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Here is the God-honest truth:</p>
    <p>If you don't have Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, <i>you are building a sand castle with your life. It doesn't matter how pretty the sand castle looks. A tsunami is coming. And if you do not know Jesus Christ, you are playing in the sand, unaware that the tsunami is quickly approaching the very foundations of your existence. <b>WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING - building a castle out of sand which is already set to be destroyed?</b></i></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Come to Jesus. He has promised a mansion built on everlasting stone, to all who believe in Him. What is stopping you from believing? You have a mansion waiting for you, and an eternal family of amazing people and creations if you could just believe in the truth...</p>
    <p>Because the alternative is going to be awful. A world without the goodness of God...Truly we cannot imagine the horror to an accurate degree. Don't find out the extent of the horror when it's too late to be saved. Destroy your sand castle <i>now</i>, and get busy on building your life with Christ as the foundation.</p>
    <p>I don't want you to get to the end of your existence, and it all have been for a sand castle which no longer is...</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>There is an amazing, beautiful, powerful God out there, and getting to know Him alone is the most spectacular journey anyone can choose to take. And one of the wonderful things about it, is that it is all about <i><b>your</b> very own personal relationship with the Creator of the heavens and the earth</i>...How amazing is that? That the Lord in His great love pursues us, mere men and women, and wants to engage with us one on one.</p>
    <p>Phillipians 3:7-11 - </p>
    <p><b>"At one time all these things of the world were important to me. But because of Christ, I decided that they are worth nothing.</p>
      <p>Not only these things, but now I think that all things are worth nothing compared with the greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. Because of Christ, I lost all these things, and now I know that they are all worthless trash. All I want now is Christ.</p>
      <p>I want to belong to him. In Christ I am right with God, but my being right does not come from following the law. It comes from God through faith. God uses my faith in Christ to make me right with him.</p>
      <p>All I want is to know Christ and the power that raised him from death. I want to share in his sufferings and be like him even in his death.</p>
      <p>Then there is hope that I myself will somehow be raised from death."</p></b>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>He is only a genuine prayer away. <i>The Lord of all creation is only a prayer away and so often we find ourselves busy with other things of the world...</i></p>
    <p>Psalm 145:18-19 - </p>
    <p><b>The Lord is near to all who call upon Him, To all who call upon Him in truth.</p></b>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>You are not exempt from this truth, you simply must make Him and His kingdom a priority, and all else falls into place...</p>
    <p>Proverbs 8:17 - </p>
    <p><b>"I love those who love me; And those who diligently seek me WILL FIND ME."</b></p>
    <p>I, like you, have spent many hours seeking all kinds of things - but where do all the things we seek come from? What is the true source of goodness in experience? What has the power to give life and to take it away? Who sculpted your features? Who brought you into existence?</p>
    <p><b><i>YOU ARE SO VALUABLE TO THE LORD THAT HE LITERALLY DIED FOR YOU. HE WANTS TO BE WITH YOU SO MUCH THAT HE DIED SO IT COULD HAPPEN.</p>
      <p>HE HAS ALREADY ACCEPTED YOU AS YOU ARE. HE WANTS <h1>YOU!</h1>
        <p>HE DOESN'T WANT THE GOOD THINGS YOU HAVE DONE. HE DOESN'T WANT THE BAD THINGS YOU HAVE DONE. HE WANTS YOU.</p>
        <p>DON'T THINK YOUR WORTHY? HE ALREADY SET THE INFINITE PRICE FOR YOU - THE BLOOD OF HIS OWN SON!</p>
        <p>DON'T THINK HE WANTS YOU? HE CAME IN THE FLESH, IN THE LIKENESS OF MEN, LIVED A PERFECT AND SINLESS LIFE AND DIED FOR YOU WHEN NO ONE ASKED HIM TO AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY RIGHT IN NOT DOING SO!</p>
        <p>DON'T THINK HE LOVES YOU? THEN YOU HAVE NOT TAKEN A GOOD LOOK AT THE CROSS AND WHY HE DID WHAT HE DID!</p>
        <p>STILL DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THIS? STILL DON'T WANT TO GET TO KNOW THE LORD? TOO BAD, THE LORD CARES FOR YOU AND THE CROSS AND THE LIFE, DEATH, AND RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST WILL BE A TESTAMENT THAT HE DOES.</p>
        <p>HE DIED ON THE CROSS SO THAT HE COULD ACCEPT YOU. THE ONLY THING MISSING IS YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF HIM AND WHAT HE DID.</p></b></i>
        <p>That's all that's up to you. Do you honestly believe in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and that what He did for you is enough?</p>
        <p><b>Admit that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior.</b> This means you truly understand that you are a deeply imperfect human being at your core. That there is no amount of good or bad you can do to save you from doing what is not right in this life. That you are a slave to evil thoughts, desires, and actions, and you do not have the power to free yourself from the chains of this evil. You need Jesus Christ, the only Savior for humanity, to save you from a life of evil, and an eternity afterward of what happens to that which is evil.</p>
        <p><b>Believe in your heart Jesus Christ and His true gospel.</b> This means you truly understand that Jesus Christ really is who He says He is. He really did die on the cross for your sins, was buried for three days, and then rose on the third day in accordance with the scriptures. He really is the Son of God, the Word of God, and you know Him as the Lord of your life. Because you believe in the truth of what Jesus has called you to do, you follow Him wherever you go. You trust Him wherever you are. And no matter the circumstance, whether you are feeling the highest of highs or the lowest of lows, you turn to Him because you know all of your life and all of its moments therein He has given to you freely for His good work and purposes.</p>
        <p><b>Call upon His name.</b> Do not forget the Lord your God! Continue to walk with the Lord for the rest of your days, inspired by the truth of His love which is displayed for everyone by the actions of the cross.</p>
        <p><b>Admit</b> you're a sinner, <b>believe</b> in the gospel of Jesus Christ, and <b>call</b> upon His name AND YOU WILL BE SAVED. YOU WILL HAVE A PLACE IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD, SPECIALLY PREPARED BY JESUS HIMSELF. BUT YOU GOTTA BELIEVE. YOU GOTTA HAVE FAITH...</p>
        <p>***</p>
      <p>It will be the best thing you ever did. Don't shoot yourself in the foot (more like your own soul, really) and overlook the truth of Jesus Christ...</p>
      <p>***</p>



    <p>Ephesians 5:14 - </p>
    <p><b>"Yes, everything is made clear by the light. This is why we say...</p>

<h1>
    <u><b><i>Hello World!</i></b></u>
  </h1>

  <!--Opening story-->
    <p>We were in line, as we always were, a bunch of back-breaking bricks on our back.</p>
    <p>But there was a way out, as there always was.</p>
    <p>I peaked in and my heart awoke, and I was glad, really glad for the first time in my life.</p>
    <p>"Look," someone told me. "I have seen the way out of here, and Pharaoh, the prince of the air on the earth, is set on not letting the way in its true form shine everywhere, lest his slaves awake from their slumber, and choose the truth over him. Tomorrow, as you go in line with your fellow slaves, look for me in the brush."</p>
    <p>And so I went back to our barracks and slept restlessly that night. In the morn, according to our master's call, we loaded up the day's bricks on our back and got in line, and began the day's trek, one after the other.</p>
    <p>When we passed the brush, a hand stuck out for me, and I leapt to it, and it pulled me through to the other side. It happened so quickly, I thought we had been subtle. But lo, three of my fellow slaves hurried in after me.</p>
    <p>"What is the matter?" they cried, confused at my behavior.</p>
    <p>I told them the truth:</p>
    <p>"A voice sent a hand</p>
    <p>And the hand offered</p>
    <p>To free me from the line</p>
    <p>Bearing bricks until death."</p>
    <p>And now, on the other side,</p>
    <p>A great chasm opened up, and from the mouth of the chasm I heard the voice.</p>
    <p>It said: "Jump and let my righteousness catch you and transform you."</p>
    <p>"Do you hear it?" I said, my voice dripping with joy, to my fellow slaves. "There is a type of music on this other side, and it is the purest and most wonderful I have ever heard. It is telling us to jump, away from the world we were in previously, the world of Pharaoh and slavery and bricks of no lasting worth, and toward Him and His kingdom."</p>
    <p>"What madness do you speak of?" said the first fellow slave.</p>
    <p>"Jump into <i>that</i>? said the second fellow slave.</p>
    <p>"Fool," said the third. "There is nothing there to catch you when you fall."</p>
    <p>"Far be it from me to choose for my brothers and sisters on the line, but why are you so eager to get back to the line, where Pharaoh has you working for him day and night, all for fading and extraneous creature comforts?"</p>
    <p>"Fool," said the first. "Bricks are the way of the world."</p>
    <p>"Fool," said the second. "What we do on the side we are born into is honorable and good."</p>
    <p>"Fool," said the third. "You may jump into vanity while we will return to matters of worth."</p>
    <p>The voice was fixing to erupt, but I knew not whether it was due to anger or excitement.</p>
    <p>"Do you hear it too? The truest musician, the composer of you and me, He has said that all the bricks that are of Pharaoh, the ruler and prince of this present earth, and of Pharaoh's slaves, all those numb to the symphony surrounding them, the people bound to this earth, will, in the end, crumble into less than nothing. And He will flip everything new when the time is right, and all of our back-breaking brick building will have been in vain. And only those with Him will stand to see the days."</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>"I wish I could say great words that broke through to your heart, fellow slave, words that pierced your soul and awoke you at once, glad like never before.</p>
    <p>"But all I have are the words on this page and the words before you now:</p>
    <p><i>It is in Pharaoh's best interest to diminish the true Savior.</i></p>
    <p><i>It is in Pharaoh's best interest to convince you that Egypt is all there is, that there isn't a promised land for you to dwell, actually free from Pharaoh's spells.</i></p>
    <p><i>It is in Pharaoh's best interest to convince you that the power of Christ is null and the character of Christ is questionable.</i></p>
    <p><i>It is in Pharaoh's best interest to make you love Egypt and its comforts, make you addicted to them, so much so that you are content to carry on for the rest of your life, saying in your heart, "Look at all of us intelligent and capable Egyptians, building bricks to the sky for ourselves and for our master. Surely Egypt is all there is! Surely we are meant to be and act as Egyptians! Surely we are right in doing our best as Egyptians! The way of the world is the way of the brick, and the way of a person in the world is to bear the brick, accumulate bricks, and build a grand old tower of personally significant bricks, all to the glory of a lost moment in the blink of an eye."</i></p>
    <p>But something was missing, and my fellow slaves could not believe a word I had said.</p>
    <p>"You're crazy," said the first.</p>
    <p>"You're lost," said the second.</p>
    <p>"Fool," said the third. "My bricks are mighty and my tower is high, my spirit is wise and it is I who am right. Behold, I will have great honor among our fellow slaves at the end of my life when the whole world will perceive all of my greatness, surely in the form of bricks borne here in Egypt."</p>
    <p>I winced in pain for the chasm between us was steep and gloomy, deep and long.</p>
    <p>My fellow slaves ran back through the brush to the other side, but before the brush closed, I heard Pharaoh yelling from the top of his throne so all the land could hear -</p>
    <p>"I have heard, my slaves, there are rumors going around that you are not bound to bearing bricks and serving me, rumors that there is a better way of life for those in the land of Egypt. I'd like to inform you of some cold hard facts, and I assure you these are scientifically proven, so the rational side of you may rest easy in this truth:</p>
    <p>"One, there are so many rumors of so many different ways out of Egypt. Do you actually think that one of them is true? This is absurd. Either all are true or all are false, or at least some are true and the rest are false, but do you actually think that one way could be the only way out of the land? You must be a lunatic to believe otherwise.</p>
    <p>"Two, I have been generous in my giving to you in the land of Egypt - you have had bread to eat, a place to rest your head, and <i>I have provided much circus for your attention, much entertainment surely not to distract you, much fabrication and falsehood surely not to lead you down my path of destruction - I promise you, if only you stay in line, and enjoy the bread and circuses I have set conveniently before you, you will be so busy with my distractions that you will be happy!</i> Do you actually think that there is a better place than the land before you now? Do you actually think that there is more to life than what you can see and touch and feel? This is absurd. You must be a fool to believe otherwise.</p>
    <p>"And lastly, remember, just as you learned in school, I promise you - it is a good thing to bear bricks, for I promise you, I use them for a good purpose. The more you believe that it is good to slave away for bricks, and to build cute little pyramids of accomplishment and experience for yourself, and the more you stay in line with the others who also have their own dreamed up brick quotas to build and bear, I promise you, the happier you will be in the long run. This is Pharaoh's promise."</p>
    <p>And I was astonished, on the other side of the brush, because the crowd of Egyptians erupted in applause.</p>
    <p>But because I had put faith in the hand that brought me to the other side, and because I chose to listen to the voice of the Law, I recoiled in disgust at the noise I heard from the Egyptian side of life. How ever had I listened to Pharaoh's promises before? I must've been under some odd spell, because Pharaoh's voice had turned into the most repulsive sound imaginable. And I cried and lamented much in that hour, for Pharaoh was given power over his slaves, and he wielded it selfishly, yet they thought what they did was good for themselves, but, behold, every letter in every language Pharaoh took advantage of to spread conniving and sadistic and <i>hidden-like-you-wouldn't-believe</i> lies.</p>
    <p>I jumped. Past the abyss, I fell into a meadow, light in every direction.</p>
    <p>"Now," I heard the voice say, so much music in one syllable.</p>
    <p>And in the distance I saw the great and grand pyramids of Egypt, where every brick of every one of Pharaoh's people was brought together and piled high, a magnificent feat in the sight of men. And I saw billions of tiny pyramids too.</p>
    <p>And no sooner did I hear now then a foot descended from heaven and crushed and crumbled all that was in the land of Egypt.</p>
    <p>Awestruck, I realized my legs had been pushing daisies in the meadow I had fallen into. As I stood up, I began to rub my eyes - I was tired, and I didn't know exactly where I was, but I knew there was a lot of light around! And as I was rubbing my eyes, "How You Been?" by Harrison Fjord began playing from precisely the 1:35 mark, just before the guitar absolutely shreds.</p>
    <p>I opened my eyes, witnessed the great expanse of light which touched all that I could see, and said to myself, and no one heard,</p>
    <p>"Oh my, oh my,</p>
    <p>There was so much strife and it was all a lie,</p>
    <p>Striving to win at a game where you die,</p>
    <p>Souls breaking and hearts crying,</p>
    <p>Children lost and people pining,</p>
    <p>Always working and always trying</p>
    <p>Never resting and never finding,</p>
    <p>The harmony in the discord</p>
    <p>The Word of God</p>
    <p>true and powerful</p>
    <p>living and active</p>
    <p>sharper than any double-edged sword</p>

    <p>Oh damn oh damn</p>
    <p>you would not believe</p>
    <p>what I got in my thoughts</p>
    <p>is like the spear of a dream</p>
    <p>piercing all of</p>
    <p>these words flow like water</p>
    <p>down the stream of truth</p>
    <p>not a single gleam unfettered</p>
    <p>no love unsheltered</p>
    <p>no no no son</p>
    <p>you have no idea what is comin'</p>
    <p>the love that I'm about to spurt from my lips to the tips of my failing phalanges</p>
    <p>oh you haven't got a clue what I've been brewin' down deep in my soul of souls</p>
    <p>it's about to blow</p>
    <p>oh no no no</p>
    <p>I gotta say</p>
    <p>it's a beautiful day</p>
    <p>and this is how it's gonna stay that way:</p>
    <p>Once upon a time there was the most misunderstood man you could ever imagine</p>
    <p>and he knew not himself</p>
    <p>but he had a hunch over lunch</p>
    <p>that the strife of life pointed to the anointed by God with a bod</p>
    <p>no sod</p>
    <p>just succulent nutrients of the sweetest honey</p>
    <p>so homey was his heart that he wandered the ends of the earth</p>
    <p>proclaiming not shaming the truth in us all which is hailed from heaven</p>
    <p>and behold he only had five loaves of bread and two fish in his pockets</p>
    <p>but a sinister sick voice said take the pocket pretty</p>
    <p>but the misheard heathen listened not</p>
    <p>and quickly fastened his ears to the hum of his own heart</p>
    <p>and the rhythm spelled out a questionable question</p>
    <p>that's quest was to identify truth</p>
    <p>for no soul on earth had filled the shoes that truth demanded</p>
    <p>but behold:</p>
    <p>surfing on the waves of heaven and crashing onto earth in a manger the chosen one was born</p>
    <p>and here we are discussing the only person who ever knew</p>
    <p>who ever got it - that elusive it that we're all chasing and wanting and is the literal epitome of desire</p>
    <p>He has it</p>
    <p>that sinless beast of a man</p>
    <p>holy and righteous was his walk</p>
    <p>and timeless and wholesome was his victory on the cross</p>
    <p>and what is the cross but the symbol of the act that is the literal epitome of love</p>
    <p>and I am here writing this now to tell you what your very soul craves:</p>
    <p>the love and relationship that is only shown and provided by Jesus Christ</p>
    <p>for behold,</p>
    <p>that questionable question was "what is truth"</p>
    <p>and it is an ill-fated inquiry of humanity for we had it wrong from the first word</p>
    <p>for the true question of love is "who is truth"</p>
    <p>and all is null that doesn't benefit the ordained endeavor of the answer to that question</p>
    <p>who is Christ Jesus</p>
    <p>who walked and talked and ate with sinners</p>
    <p>to save those that listened and believed from their sins</p>
    <p>and to serve those</p>
    <p>and to give them His own reward</p>
    <p>which is eternal life with the Father of creation</p>
    <p>and behold,</p>
    <p>that makes me your brother in humanity</p>
    <p>whoever you are reading this</p>
    <p>and so,</p>
    <p>from a brother to another</p>
    <p>heed my message and my message is this:</p>
    <br />
    <p>I LOVE YOU.</p>
    <br />
    <p>But you are loved so much more by the God who gave His only son so that you may be with Him.</p>

        <br />
        <p>It has taken far too long, but I now finally realize the following - people want to hear certain things from certain people. I know - shocking, right? <i>People want to hear what they want to hear</i>. And anything that is opposed to that makes them grumble. So rather than always deal with the griping of in-person conversation concerning such seemingly controversial topics such as God and life and death, I've decided to create this website. For the beauty in this is that you read what I write if you want to or are curious about what I've said and for no other reason. No one is forcing you to read thus far, and that's a wonderful and beautiful thing. If you want to go and do something else and forget about everything I've said on here, you totally can, and you totally should if that's how you genuinely feel.</p>
        <p>But if there's a part of you that is curious about questioning the nature of things around you, I urge you to read on, with the upmost yearning for joy and for life and for this moment, because I promise you - there is a level of connection out there that is so beautiful I want everyone to have it even if it kills me.</p>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQZw9Ca4tX0" target="_blank">Beauty</a>

        <p>There is so much beauty in the world. If you blink, you'll miss it.</p>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbJP-_Oasks" target="_blank">Yep.</a>
        <p>I’ll say it before, and I’ll say it again. Life moves pretty fast. You don’t stop and look around once and awhile, you could miss it.</p>
        <p>You don’t stop and give a real good look at the brevity of existence, the vanity of human pursuit, and yet the simultaneous and inescapable beauty of life – you <i>will</i> miss it.</p>
        <p>It's like my whole life I have been stumbling, fumbling to articulate these words which are before you now.</p>
        <p>This is as delicately as I can put it.</p>
        <p>I've done quite a bit of thinking and as of now I have quite a bit to say…</p>
        <p>Long has my soul been wanting to communicate this message to anyone and everyone, and now that I have the time, the perspective, the words, and the will, I finally may do so.</p>
        <p>What I have sought out of life is how to live it in full.</p>
        <p>My credentials are my credentials. You will either like what I have to say or you will not. So do not let any externalities influence your judgment on my message. Judge the message. And if you find the message to be sound and of good nature, then you know you can trust the messenger.</p>
        <p>I have sought to ponder the complexities of the universe and likewise the human spirit and I have loved every firing of every neuron.</p>
        <p>Let me level with you, like a man.</p>
        <p>I was sent here to tell you the most wonderful news - and I fear that if you blink, you may miss it.</p>

          <p class="phosphate">"I'd tell you all you want and more, if the sounds I made could be what you hear."</p>
          <p> - David Foster Wallace, <i>Infinite Jest</i></p>
          <br />
          <p>If you are searching for a sign, this is it.</p>
          <p>If you are reading this, it's not too late.</p>
          <br />
          <p class="phosphate">"We have, each of us, a life-story, an inner narrative - whose continuity, whose sense, is our lives. It might be said that each of us constructs and lives, a 'narrative', and that this narrative is us, our identities. If we wish to know about a man, we ask 'what is his story - his real, inmost story?' - for each of us is a biography, a story. Each of us is a singular narrative, which is constructed, continually, unconsciously, by, through, and in us - through our perceptions, our feelings, our thoughts, our actions; and, not least, our discourse, our spoken narrations. Biologically, physiologically, we are not so different from each other; historically, as narratives - we are each of us unique. To be ourselves we must have ourselves - possess, if need be re-possess, our life stories. We must 'recollect' ourselves, recollect the inner drama, the narrative, of ourselves. A man needs such a narrative, a continuous inner narrative, to maintain his identity, his self."
          </p>
          <p> - Oliver Sacks, <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat</i></p>
          <br />
          <p>Life is precious.</p>
          <p>Life is all about relationships. It is about the moments you share with the people beside you.</p>
          <p>In order to have a relationship, you must sacrifice something – whether it be time, opportunity, or your very own life. A relationship, at the very least, is made up of two distinct entities that choose to engage with each other because it is mutually beneficial to do so.</p>
          <p>Ask anyone that has been in the trenches of a relationship and they will tell you what a successful relationship really all boils down to – communication.</p>
        <p><u>What is communication?</u></p>
          <p>Communication is the absolute most important component to a thriving and mutually beneficial relationship. Why is this true? Because communication breeds understanding and genuine understanding within a relationship leads to a significant and better experience for everyone involved. Communication reinforces the bonds within a relationship, which is necessary to sustain it.</p>
          <p>To communicate is to pass on information.</p>
          <p>To make matters simpler, let us call one entity in a relationship the giver, when they are the ones giving information and let us call the other entity in the relationship the receiver, when they are the ones receiving the information.</p>
          <p>So, in a relationship where communication occurs, the giver passes on information to the receiver. This then increases the knowledge of the receiver of the information, ideally leading to a wiser and better suited response from the receiver, all to the benefits of all parties involved.</p>
        <p><u>Why do we communicate?</u></p>
          <p>In a functioning relationship, both sides communicate with each other. One side gives a message which the other side receives. Then, the roles are reversed, and the one who received now gives, and the one who gave now receives. On and on and on, all to the benefit of both sides in a healthy and righteous relationship. This is how a relationship works.</p>
          <p>This is the gift of life - to be able to engage in relationships and interactions and encounters with one another, to be able to share great moments of all kinds.</p>
          <p>And that’s the funny thing about this world that we currently share – if you are human and you have the breath of life in you, you crave a certain kind of connection with whoever is around you. You crave to be known by others and to know others. You crave to be loved by others and to love others. You crave to be wanted by others and to want others. You crave to experience others and have others experience you.</p>
          <p>And that is why we communicate – to be known and to know, to be loved and to love, to be wanted and to want, and to be experienced and to experience.</p>
          <p>And that too is what we desire out of life – to be known and to know, to be loved and to love, to be wanted and to want, and to be experienced and to experience. To give and receive.</p>
          <p>It is put more eloquently in <i>Children of the Mind</i> by Orson Scott Card: "No, she doesn't want that. Not in her deepest heart. She wants what everyone wants - to be loved and cared for, to be part of something beautiful and fine, to have the respect of those she admires."</p>
          <p>I firmly believe, on some level, all individuals want the above. Even those that would swear otherwise. We all want to have good experiences, and if we cannot find the love that our soul craves, or be part of something that is beautiful and fine, or garner the respect from esteemed individuals, then we search for those feelings elsewhere, often times at the expense of overtly vain and selfish pursuits.</p>
          <p>Here is what I want to reiterate at this point:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Life is about relationships.</li>
              <li>Communication is what makes or breaks a relationship.</li>
            </ol>
          <p>We all experience life (and relationships in life (and communication within relationships in life)) <i>hoping for what is really the same thing</i> - some<i>thing</i> (or perhaps, some<i>one</i>) that provides the love that we truly crave, the wisdom that we truly desire, and the relationship fulfillment which we all yearn for.</p>
          <p>In fact, some<i>thing</i> cannot provide the love we truly crave, because it takes a person (or some intelligent identity) to actually, verbally, actively <i>love</i>.</p>
          <p>Some<i>thing</i> cannot provide the wisdom that we truly desire, because in order to imitate true wisdom, there needs to be a personal example in one's life. You need to see and know a wise <i>person</i> to properly understand wisdom.</p>
          <p>Some<i>thing</i> cannot fulfill us from a relational standpoint, because there is no real relationship between an individual and some<i>thing</i>. The individual may give information and the individual may receive information - but the object, the thing - no matter how much it imitates identity - cannot genuinely give information and receive information - at least not to the extent another human being may.</p>
          <p>No, life is about genuine and authentic relationships between people. No screen, no virtual reality, no artificial intelligence, no inauthentic experience of reality will satiate our palate for fulfilling relationships, but face-to-face honest communication between individuals. Life is about meeting amazing people and cultivating authentic and wonderful relationships with the people around you. But that’s not it, either. This paragraph is close to what it’s all about, but it is not it entirely.</p>
          <p>Life is about <i>the</i> someone. Life is about the someone that can and will provide the love we truly crave, the wisdom we truly desire, and the relationship fulfillment we all yearn for. Because if you know what it means to be human, then you know, to your core, no doubt, that to be human is to love imperfectly, to frolic in folly and hypocrisy and sin, and to demand a certain selflessness in others that you fail to provide yourself. So, in this world, it is not enough to know and be known, to love and be loved, to want and be wanted, to experience and be experienced by the imperfection of others because we are designed to be fulfilled by the perfection of the ultimate epitome of relationship – the relationship between oneself and the Lord God Almighty.</p>
          <p>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
          <p>First things first.</p>
          <p>So there is life. And life is a series of relationships. And the quality of relationships are increased through communication.</p>
        <p><u>And so to what end do we all go through life communicating often with many people?</u></p>
          <p>Bearing in mind that we all want basically the same thing – to know and to be known, to love and to be loved, to want and to be wanted, and to experience and be experienced – why is there so much corruption, hatred, murder, slander, gossip, misunderstanding, brokenness, fraud, illness, depression, jealousy and pure sheer evil in this world of ours?</p>
          <p>By and large, people have goodness in their heart and people will do good things if called upon, if they understand it is worthwhile to do the good thing. But here's an issue in this world of man: no one asks, no one reaches out, no one takes just and righteous advantage of their peers and the world around them. <i>Something halts us from great communication and the ability to follow through on trusting others.</i></p>
          <p>And that something is fear. Because communicating intimately with someone requires a certain vulnerability that we all are typically only comfortable sharing with a husband or a wife, and tragically, often times not even then.</p>
          <p>But what if it was possible to not let that fear build up walls your ego guards day and night? What if it was possible to let love tear down those walls that, while deceptively claiming to be keeping you safe from the outside world, are in reality keeping the outside world from seeing your honest self who is truly brilliant, especially when understood completely?</p>
          <p>But that's a question for those born again, those who produce <b><i><u>LIFE</u></i></b> by the power of the <b><i><u>ULTIMATE LIFE-GIVER</u></i></b>.</p>
          <p>And we are all born busy in death. But the beautiful thing is – we get to decide. We have the power to choose. Death or life. Ourselves or others. Selfishness or selflessness. Hate of rivals or love for enemies. Stubbornness or forgiveness. Wrong or right. Evil or good.</p>
          <p>And as I grow older and older and eventually die here on this putrid earth which rots in sin, I can feel my sense of hearing dying too. And that depresses me greatly, because music is a wonderful thing. But, though the cacophony and confusion of reality produces a lot of noise in the ears of a person inclined to hear, it all remains gorgeously melodious music <i>because I know the someone who can and will and did and does provide the richest love in all of existence, the someone who genuinely wants to engage in authentic relationship with every single human being, the someone who not only wants to know and be known, to love and be loved, to want and be wanted, to experience and be experienced - but is the catalyst and overseer and LORD of every relationship ever.</i> AND BECAUSE OF HIM - BECAUSE OF THE LORD GOD - BEAUTY ABOUNDS, LOVE SPREADS, GRACE SURVIVES, PEOPLE LIVE, AND THE WHEEL OF HISTORY CONTINUES TO ROLL DOWN HIS PATH OF MYSTERIOUS GLORY.</p>
          <p>And so, I now reveal to you what this website is.</p>
          <p>This is a call to those who are <i>alive</i>. The phone is ringing, my friend. Pick up! There's someone at the door. Go open it!</p>
          <p>And to those who are dead or dying - this is my serenade, my song, my heart-throbbing, gut-wrenching, last-ditch cry for you to die to deathly and lawless ways, to see self-seeking for the chaotic vanity that it is, and ultimately to be disciplined in righteousness and repentance through an undying trust in the righteousness of the Lord God.</p>
          <p>And repentance is nothing more than <i>choosing to turn away from worshipping and loving sin to, instead, like you are designed, so as to maximize the joy and love of who you are, and for the sake of your well-being, to focus all of your heart and mind and soul on loving and knowing and wanting and experiencing the Lord God, whose character and being can be found in the personhood of Jesus Christ, who lived a perfect life and then died on a cross, crucified by His people who misunderstood Him and His Word, and then three days later was resurrected from the grave, and is now seated at the right hand of Our Heavenly Father, who rules heaven and earth and has power over all, who loves His people so dearly and with such compassion that He gave His only son so that they may be with Him despite their sinful self-absorption.</i></p>

        <h2><u>PART 2 - INTRODUCTION</u></h2>
          <p>Life is characterized by movement of its own accord.</p>
          <br />
          <p>This means to be <i>alive</i></p>
          <br />
          <p>one must be in motion,</p>
          <br />
          <p>one must be changing.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Life is characterized by this ability to change.</p>
          <br />
          <p>This means</p>
          <br />
          <p>if you are stagnant in your growth,</p>
          <br />
          <p>if you are incapable of changing,</p>
          <br />
          <p>you are as good as dead.</p>
          <br />
          <p>So to live righteously is to recognize the good and evil within you, to die to that evil and to strive for the good, and <i>change</i>. And then love others with the veracity of Jesus Christ.</p>

                  <p>     So the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him;</p>
                <p>For He knows how we are formed,</p>
                  <p>     He remembers that we are dust.</p>
                <p>The life of mortals is like grass,</p>
                  <p>     They flourish like a flower of the field;</p>
                <p>The wind blows over it and it is gone,</p>
                  <p>     And its place remembers it no more.</p>
                <p>But from everlasting to everlasting</p>
                  <p>     The Lord's love is with those who fear Him,</p>
                  <p>     And His righteousness with their children's children - with those who keep His covenant</p>
                  <p>     And remember to obey his precepts.</p>
                <p>The Lord has established His throne in heaven,</p>
                  <p>     And His kingdom rules over all.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Praise the Lord, you His angels,</p>
                  <p>     You mighty ones who do His bidding,</p>
                  <p>     Who obey His word.</p>
                <p>Praise the Lord, all His heavenly hosts,</p>
                  <p>     You His servants who do His will.</p>
                <p>Praise the Lord, all His works</p>
                  <p>     Everywhere in His dominion.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Praise the Lord, my soul.</p>

            <p><u>John 5:24-33</u></p>
            <div class="phosphate">
            <p>“It’s urgent that you listen carefully to this: Anyone here who believes what I am saying right now and aligns himself with the Father, who has in fact put me in charge, has at this very moment the real, lasting life and is no longer condemned to be an outsider. This person has taken a giant step from the world of the dead to the world of the living.</p>
            <p>It’s urgent that you get this right: The time has arrived – I mean right now! – when dead men and women will hear the voice of the Son of God and, hearing, will come alive. Just as the Father has life in himself, he has conferred on the Son life in himself. And he has given him the authority, simply because he is the Son of Man, to decide and carry out matters of Judgment.</p>
            <p>Don’t act so surprised at all this. The time is coming when everyone dead and buried will hear his voice. Those who have lived the right way will walk out into a resurrection Life; those who have lived the wrong way, into a resurrection Judgment.</p>
            <p>I can’t do a solitary thing on my own: I listen, then I decide. You can trust my decision because I’m not out to get my own way but only to carry out orders. If I were simply speaking on my own account, it would be an empty, self-serving witness. But an independent witness confirms me, the most reliable Witness of all. Furthermore, you all saw and heard John, and he gave expert and reliable testimony about me, didn’t he?</p>
            <p>But my purpose is not to get your vote, and not to appeal to mere human testimony. I’m speaking to you this way so that you will be saved. John was a torch, blazing and bright, and you were glad enough to dance for an hour or so in his bright light. But the witness that really confirms me far exceeds John’s witness. It’s the work the Father gave me to complete. These very tasks, as I go about completing them, confirm that the Father, in fact, sent me. The Father who sent me, confirmed me. And you missed it. You never heard his voice, you never saw his appearance. There is nothing left in your memory of his Message because you do not take his Messenger seriously.</p>
            <p>You have your heads in your Bibles constantly because you think you’ll find eternal life there. But you miss the forest for the trees. These Scriptures are all about me! And here I am, standing right before you, and you aren’t willing to receive from me the life you say you want.</p>
            <p>I’m not interested in crowd approval. And do you know why? Because I know you and your crowds. I know that love, especially God’s love, is not on your working agenda. I came with the authority of my Father, and you either dismiss me or avoid me. If another came, acting self-important, you would welcome him with open arms. How do you expect to get anywhere with God when you spend all your time jockeying for position with each other, ranking your rivals and ignoring God?</p>
            <p>But don’t think I’m going to accuse you before my Father. Moses, in whom you put so much stock, is your accuser. If you believed, really believed, what Moses said, you would believe me. He wrote of me. If you won’t take seriously what he wrote, how can I expect you to take seriously what I speak?”</p>

          <p>A good chunk of the first part of this website will be explaining what I’m trying to get at with all these words. There are many things that I want you to understand through this message.</p>
          <p>Here are some links to some great videos. Hopefully, these compliment the sort of natural seriousness that surfaces when discussing the matters that I wish to bring to light.</p>
          <p>What I mean to tell you requires, for lack of a better word, a certain degree of maturity. And too often we think that maturity requires no sense of humor.</p>

          <p>I have found what Rob Bell says here to be spot on – what you look for, you will find.</p>
          <p>What are you looking for?</p>
          <p>What I have sought after in life can be summed up in the following questions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>What is good? And what are the fruits of being good?</li>
            <li>What is evil? And what are the fruits of being evil?</li>
            <li>What is love? And what are the fruits of loving?</li>
            <li>What is hate? And what are the fruits of hating?</li>
            <li>What is selflessness? And what are the fruits of being selfless?</li>
            <li>What is selfishness? And what are the fruits of being selfish?</li>
            <li>How may I live life to the fullest?</li>
            <li>What physical, social, intellectual, and personal pleasures are most fulfilling?</li>
            <li>What is wisdom and how does one live a wise life?</li>
            <li>How may I make the most out of my time here?</li>
            <li>How may I be a blessing to everyone I meet?</li>
            <li>How do I find true joy?</li>
            <li>Why are we here?</li>
            <li>What is my purpose?</li>
            <li>Why is there so much disconnection between people in the world?</li>
            <li>What ought I to fear and what ought I to love?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>My whole life I have yearned to stretch my eyes open to this underlying beauty which pervades our reality that can only be described as “the divine”. I have found it is not of one's own will that their eyes are opened to this all-encompassing beauty, but the sole doing of Our Heavenly Father. And per His will, I have found that we and likewise our surroundings are absolutely drenched in it.</p>
          <p>I refuse to live a life where I am not fully present. It has taken longer than I would have liked, but I have learned and am still learning how to be in love with the present moment. My fear is that many, like myself in the past, and no doubt on occasion in my future, will miss the moment. This is terrifying upon reflection, because when all is said and done, and we are able to look past our anxieties and fears concerning our troublesome past or our unknown future, the present moment is the only thing we really have.</p>
          <p>From the poem of creation to the weirdness of the universe on both a large and small scale, to dimensions and understanding, to the combination and clashing of the physical self versus the spiritual self within the human being, I have long been left speechless before the beauty surrounding me.</p>
          <p>But now I have something to say. And I'm afraid I'll be saying it until the day I die.</p>
          <p><b><i><u>THERE. IS. MORE.</u></i></b></p>
          <p>To you. To life. To your role in life. To everything. There is so much going on here, on this earth.</p>
          <p>I am so utterly convinced of it that I have dropped out of college and gone overseas to give my whole self over to the discovery and exploration of experiencing the hidden but deep beauty of life.</p>
          <p>I had to leave conventional education because, in school – at least in my own circumstances, I was quickly learning to distract myself with the mundane as well as from honestly comprehending the majesty of existence and the beauty of sacred personalities around me. (And that, my friends, is all that matters. Forget that and you are a dead man walking.) I will refuse to let the world kill me and my spirit.</p>
          <p>And so here is what the Lord did to me to get me to be where I am now.</p>
          <div id="collegeepiphany" class="angsananew">
            <p>The Lord gave me a taste of a fraction of true naked vanity - the state of our heart when we are not in tune with His composition. And what I perceived was horrifying.</p>
          </div>
          <p>I created this website in order to better illustrate to any who are curious enough what I know to be true to the core of my soul – one of many things being that life is meant to be lived in full, our potential is meant to be met, love is meant to be cherished, and above all, our relationships with others are to be adored and cultivated with care.</p>
          <p>I hope that after watching the above link, in addition to recognizing the bewildering environment surrounding you at the present moment, you may agree you and I live in an awesome and captivating reality.</p>
          <p>I have fallen in love – with the awesomeness, that is. And for a long time, I thought it was the awesomeness of this world – despite it being the chaotic mess that it is.</p>
          <p>I know I have reiterated my intentions again and again, but I must be as clear as possible with matters like these. What I’m aiming to accomplish through all of what I’m telling you is to properly and fully explain to you why we should be in consistent awe of life, people, and our potential. Now that I have the time to collect my thoughts and the will to spill my soul, I am going to explain to the best of my ability why our duty is to love the truth through our actions and our hearts – and this especially means <i>not</i> doing whatever is right in our own eyes. I am going to explain how we should have no fear of all earthly endeavors that seek to plague our minds with dread, <i>especially</i> when we know that heaven is knocking at our door. And, ultimately, I’m going to answer the question that has plagued my mind my entire life:</p>

        <div id="partthree" class="themessage">
          <h2><u>PART 3 - BREAKFAST</u></h2>
          <p>First, let us paint a picture of what life is. Please watch <i>Pulp Fiction</i> by Quentin Tarantino in full and get back to me. This section will only make sense if you have seen the movie recently.</p>
          <p>Though a film is a falsely created reality, a series of deliberate illusions, and though the actual narrative of <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is entirely fictional, I believe that <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is packed with so many aspects of reality that it deserves to be understood in full. Now, this film is so amazing because it resonates with reality in a variety of ways that, upon further inquiry, accurately correlate with the world as we know it. I am going to illustrate what these different aspects are and use <i>Pulp Fiction</i> as a platform to define what life is.</p>
          <p>If this website is anything, it is the equivalent of Jules Winnfield sitting down with Vincent Vega for breakfast as they discuss the happenings of their world. Both men experienced something. Both men experienced life that morning. One is unaffected by the coincidences around him and the other is deeply moved by the miracles around him. One dismisses life as chance and a series of random movements, indecipherable coincidence. And the other is confident that something higher and greater than themselves is involved, in control, and orchestrating something greater than what we can imagine. I’m here to tell you, go, look around you, go outside to the highest hill in your neighborhood, gaze up into the sky, feel the silent buzz of the atmosphere enveloping you, be keenly aware of the intricacies of your heart and the complexity of your mind and listen as carefully as you can to the words of Mr. Winnfield: “This was divine intervention.”</p>
          <p>And odds are you do not have the effort to continue reading - that is, assuming you have punished your time and eyes thus far at all. Or, you do not believe reading what I have to say would be worthwhile. And that is a fine and reasonable conclusion. By all means, return to what you would rather do or what you need to be doing. But, please, for your sake, question the reality around you and truly seek to know if there is indeed more to life than what meets the eye. And if this is where our time together stops, I have to leave you with the only proper response I can think of, courtesy of Jules Winnfield himself: “Don’t do that. Don’t fuckin’ blow this shit off. What happened here was a fuckin’ miracle. This shit doesn’t just happen. We should be fuckin’ dead, my friend. What happened here was a miracle and I want you to fucking acknowledge it.”</p>
          <p>***</p>
          <p>Right now, I’m Jules, and you and I, we’re out to breakfast. It’s early, and we have a full day ahead of us. The sun is beaming down hot, sweet, succulent sunshine and the diner we’re at is alive with chatter, busy brains, and meandering minds. I am going to let the conversation between the gangster and soon to be ex-gangster ensue as a prelude to what I must tell you concerning <i>Pulp Fiction</i> and life as we know it.</p>
          <div class="courier">
            <p>Vincent Vega: “Oh man, that’s good. That’s good, man. You’re, like, starting to lighten up. You’ve been sittin’ there, all serious and shit.”</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Man, I’ve just been sittin’ here thinkin’.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "About what?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "About the miracle we witnessed."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "The miracle <i>you</i> witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "What is a miracle, Vincent?"</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "An act of God."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "And what's an act of God?"</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "When, um, God makes the impossible possible. But, this morning I don't think qualifies."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Hey Vincent, don’t you see, that shit don’t matter. Your judgin’ this shit the wrong way. I mean it could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke to Pepsi, he found my fuckin’ car keys. You don’t judge shit like this based on merit. Now whether or not what we experienced was an according to Hoyle miracle is insignificant. But what is significant, is I felt the touch of God. God got involved.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "But why?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Well, that’s what’s fuckin’ with me, I don’t know why. But I can’t go back to sleep.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "You serious? You really thinkin' about quittin'?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "The life?"</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Yeah."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "Most definitely."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Fuck. Whatcha gonna do then?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Well, that’s what I’ve been sitting here, contemplating. First, I’m going to deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I’m just going to walk the Earth.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Whatchu mean, "walk the earth"?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “You know, like Caine in Kung Fu. Walk from place to place…meet people…get in adventures.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "And how long do you intend to walk the earth?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "Until God puts me where He wants me to be."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "And what if He don't do that?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "Well, if it takes forever, then I'll walk forever."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "So you decided to be a bum?"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "I'll just be Jules, Vincent. No more, no less."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: “No, Jules, you decided to be a bum. Just like all those pieces of shit out there that beg for change, who sleep in garbage bins, who eat what I throw away. They got a name for that, Jules. It’s called a <i>bum</i>. And without a job, a residence, or legal tender, that’s what you’re gonna be man – a fuckin’ <i>bum</i>.”</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Jules, look, what happened this morning, man, I agree, it was peculiar, but water into wine, I -"</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "All shapes and sizes, Vincent."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man."</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: "If my answers frighten you, Vincent, then you should cease asking scary questions."</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: “I’m gonna take a shit…Let me ask you somethin’. When did you make this decision, when you were sittin’ there eatin’ that muffin’?”</p>
            <p>Jules Winnfield: “Well yeah. I was sittin’ here eatin’ my muffin and drinkin’ my coffee, replayin’ the incident in my head, when I had, what alcoholics refer to as “a moment of clarity”.”</p>
            <p>Vincent Vega: "Fuck. To be continued."</p>
          </div>
          <p>This is the situation that I am presented with. I am like Jules in that I have felt the touch of God. God got involved. And the world is like Vincent in that it does not understand Jules and it absolutely does not know nor understand the God that has been involved in Jules’ whole life.</p>
          <p>This is a God who is involved in all of our lives, whether we know it or not. This is a God of love, a God that seeks a relationship with you, yes, YOU READING THIS. The Great Creator, the Righteous Judge, the Sovereign King, the Ruling-Center-of-All-That-Is, the Great-I-Am loves you more than you can imagine. The problem is, in order for love in a relationship to be realized, both parties have to want to engage with each other. And so God will never force you to do anything with Him. He will let you do as you see fit, if you so wish. (How amazing is that? The freedom He gives us...) But doing as you see fit outside of a relationship with God will only lead to despair in the long run (whether in this life or the next), because all that is good comes from the Lord - every gift of every kind. But I am, and many others are, here to tell you that a relationship with God is what is lacking in all of us. And God has revealed himself through his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
          <p>I began seeking God not too long ago and now that I see sin for what it is, and truth for what it is, I see God was and is and will be with me always. And I haven’t uncovered anywhere close to half of all the wonder and joy and glory of life, but I know that I am onto something that is absolutely and amazingly good. And I know that the love that I am near to is what we <i>all</i> long for at the core of our being – the love and relationship and fulfillment provided by Jesus Christ. Many hate Jesus Christ and therefore love death (because Jesus Christ is who brings forth life...), but I know that if everyone could see Jesus for who he is, and come to know Him for who he is, they would realize that He is what they have been seeking in everything. He is the solution to all of our problems. He is the answer to all of our questions. He is the author of all the brilliance that you are blessed to know.</p>
          <p>Hear me out on all that I have to say and I believe it will have been well worth your time.</p>
          <p>Back to what life is.</p>
          <p>Here is the argument I am making. <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is like life and life is like <i>Pulp Fiction</i>. Here's why.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Life is a <i>story</i>, just like how <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is a story.
            <p>A story is a narrative designed to interest, amuse, or instruct the reader or listener. A narrative is an account or series of events or experiences. In other words, a story is a series of experiences meant to grip the attention of the person experiencing the story. A story has a beginning and an end, and a middle full of conflict. Whether you agree or not, you have a beginning and an end, and a middle that is full of ups and downs and highs and lows and good times and bad times. A story has a protagonist, a primary character that it follows. You are the protagonist of <i>your</i> story, and you interact regularly with secondary characters that have influence on your day and what you do in it. Conversely, you play the role of a secondary character in the lives of many other people, some more than others.</p>
            <p>In Pulp Fiction, there are six relatively main characters. Now each of those individual characters follow their own narrative arc. Some overlap, some don’t. So it is with our lives. We all are the main character of our own life. We all are the center of our own world. We all are walking and talking stories.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Life as we know it now on earth is bloody and vulgar and brutal, just like the happenings of <i>Pulp Fiction</i>.
              <p>The word “fuck” is used 265 times. With 154 minutes of film, that’s an average of 1.7 fucks a minute. Perhaps we are not all so vulgar in our own lives, but at the very least we all experience things that hold the capacity to frustrate us to a crude degree.</p>
              <p>Need I remind us of the brutal sexual violence against Marsellus Wallace, or car wreck, triple homicide, uzi-murder, overdose, restaurant hostage situation that takes place throughout the film? Life is this brutal to people. It’s utter mayhem out there. And on some level, everything humans do are attempts at distractions that ease this force of brute reality. No one can handle it alone, and so we all turn to either something or someone to relinquish our pain and suffering – whether it be some form of a drug, career, entertainment, a significant other, family, or a higher power. We are all on this coarse river of life, and you can either learn how to fight the rapids the right way – with true effectiveness, or drown of exhaustion in the end – consumed by the chaos of the waves. Don't keep relying on fallible people in your life and unhelpful pursuits and objects - come to Jesus, and He will relinquish your pain and suffering forever - but you have to let Him...</p>
            </li>
            <li>Life will never go as you expect it, just like it went for the characters in <i>Pulp Fiction</i>.
              <p>There are essentially six primary characters that are followed throughout Pulp Fiction. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, Mia Wallace, Vincent Vega, Jules Winnfield, and Butch Coolidge. Bearing in mind that having unexpected things happen to your characters is also just a mark of good storytelling (because then your story resembles reality!), here are some good examples.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are the two misfits aiming to get money by robbing a place.
                  Here is some dialogue from the first scene of the movie.

Waitresses, fuckin’ forget it. No way they’re takin’ a bullet for the register. Bus boys, some wetbag gettin’ paid a dollar fifty an hour, really give a fuck you’re stealin’ from the owner.

                <br />
                  <p>So it is with us and our life. I guarantee you that you will be hit with the unexpected, and your life will never go quite as you wish it.</p>
                  <p>If there is anything we can take away from all these examples, it is that, in the end, when it is all said and done, life never happens like you would expect it to. How long must we, in our insanity, expect the same things to produce different results? How long will we have to expect and expect and expect? How long will we have to lie to ourselves until we realize that our own agenda and our own fantasies will never play out exactly like we want them to in life? How long will it take for us to realize that <i>this world that we are in is not about our own individual agendas and pursuits?</i></p>
                  <p>There is much greater work at play here. And there is a humble invitation out there for you to get involved in this great story like you were meant to. A story about love and death and life and redemption and living for others. The alternative is, naturally, living for oneself and then dying forever. Here’s the invitation. Right here:</p>
                  <p>Matthew 16:24</p>
                  <p>"Then Jesus told His disciples,
                    <div class="redletters">
                      <p>“If anyone would come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of Man will come in His Father’s glory with His angels, and then He will repay each one according to what he has done. Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.”</p>
                    </div>
                  <p>That's it. This world is sinking and you will too. Unless you by faith join hands with the <i>only capable and true</i> person in history who knows the waters that this world is sinking in, is desperately searching for those who want to <i>live</i> rather than go down with the ship, and promises to take you to shore Himself. All you have to do is genuinely follow Him.</p>
                </li>
                <br />
              <li>There are too many "coincidences" in life for events and ourselves to be utterly random, just like how in <i>Pulp Fiction</i> the lives of the characters overlap at peculiar times.
                <p>A coincidence is defined as <i>a situation in which events happen at the same time in a way that is not planned or expected.</i>
                <p>List of prominent "coincidences" in <i>Pulp Fiction</i>:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Butch Coolidge comes into his apartment looking for his watch when Vincent Vega is on the toilet, able to use Vincent’s uzi to kill Mr. Vega.</li>
                    <li>Butch Coolidge runs into Marsellus Wallace on the way back to Fabienne as Marsellus Wallace crosses the street in front of him.</li>
                    <li>Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield evade the bullets from the “goddam hand-cannon” at the hand of the fourth man.</li>
                    <li>The one diner that Pumpkin and Honey Bunny decide to rob, thinking it will be easy because the lack of prepared people in a restaurant, is serving prepared gangsters that end up interfering.</li>
                    <li>The one gun store that Butch runs into while fleeing from Marsellus, is owned and operated by two serial rapists that kidnap both Marsellus and Butch for an afternoon.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>What is key to recognize here is how a number of coincidences like the above can easily <i>appear</i> as mere coincidence. But what is the actual case? All of these situations were orchestrated by the author of the story - in this case, Quentin Tarantino - in order to tell a <i>greater</i> story, a story that utilizes the interwoven stories of the six main characters in question - Pumpkin, Honey Bunny, Mia, Butch, Vincent, and Jules - to tell a higher and fuller and more captivating and awe-inspiring narrative (in this case, the narrative has a name: <i>Pulp Fiction</i>).</p>
                <p>So it is with this world we share. The millions of coincidences that we partake in across our lifetime has such greater impact than one who believes in randomness would think. There is order to the chaos around us, and the order can only be discerned when you understand that a much greater story is being told around you, and that <i>you</i> have the privilege to be a part of it.</p>
                <p>Now this is not a perfect metaphor for how reality is to us, but it is close:</p>
                <p>Does Butch know that he is playing a role in a movie that was created by Quentin Tarantino? Of course not – he’s busy being Butch. Does Jules know that he is playing a role in a movie that was created by Quentin Tarantino? No, he doesn’t know the full story. But he is aware that something greater than himself saved him from those bullets. He just hasn’t realized who God is and why He stopped those bullets. Jules Winnfield doesn’t know just yet that Jules Winnfield’s god is Quentin Tarantino and Quentin stopped those bullets from hitting Jules <i>and</i> Vincent in the name of a greater story.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Does the reader of these words right now know that he or she is playing a role in the great story of life that is orchestrated by the Great Composer of All Creation? That depends – either you, the reader, know the Lord and see how the Lord gives proper place, time, and opportunity to all things for His greater purpose, or you, the reader, do not know the Lord on some critical level and are busy being you. Which is fine. By all means, go and be “you”.</p>
            <p>But know that this world is full of evil <i>because</i> of our effort, by our God-given free will, to create and facilitate our own role in the movie of life rather than trust the author of all humanity to give people the best lines and the best course of action. This horrible, chaotic, evil world as we know it exists because humans do as they see fit and not as God sees fit.</p>
            <p>Because here’s the catch. God knows what is best for us. AND WE DON’T HAVE A CLUE, left alone to our own logic. We either trust ourselves (which is what leads to the world we are in now – an evil, ignorant, self-loathing, self-gratifying, self-seeking world), or we trust in God (which is how God intended us to live).</p>
            <p>Because God saw that it was good, He created man <i>in His image</i>, to be in relationship with Him. We are built for the company of God. It is why no amount of fame or worldly honor or glory or personal conquests achieved, we ever are truly satisfied. God knows this, and those that know Him, because of the depravity of man, know how desperately we <i>all</i> need Him.</p>
            <p>Here is a glimpse of what the future holds for those that choose to trust in God rather than themselves. I’m screamin’ at you, man. This is what comes at the end of the show. This is the third and final act:</p>
            <p><u>Revelations 21</u></p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,” for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”</p>
              </div>
            <p>This is the closest look at God we will ever get <i>physically</i>, before the death of our earthly bodies:</p>
            <p><u>Revelations 1</u></p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands, and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters. In his right hand, he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance. When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.”</p>
              </div>
            <p>And here is where those who trusted in Him will dwell:</p>
            <p><u>Revelations 21</u></p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it. Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.</p>
              </div>
            <p>Us humans are apt at clinching our own fate, so I know that some part of you is wondering, if all this nonsense isn’t made-up fiction after all, how do we know whether our name is on Jesus Christ’s book of life?</p>
            <p><u>Romans 10:9</u></p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.</p>
              </div>
            <p>And of course, you know your security and identity in Christ by faith:</p>
            <p><u>Hebrews 11:1-40</u></p>
              <div class="phosphate">
                <p>Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. This is what the ancients were commended for.</p>
                <p>By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.</p>
                <p>By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith he was commended as righteous, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead.</p>
                <p>By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: “He could not be found, because God had taken him away.” For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.</p>
                <p>By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith.</p>
                <p>By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. And by faith even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was enabled to bear children because she considered him faithful who had made the promise. And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.</p>
                <p>All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. Instead, they were longing for a better country – a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.</p>
                <p>By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, even though God had said to him, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.” Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of speaking he did receive Isaac back from death.</p>
                <p>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.</p>
                <p>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph’s sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.</p>
                <p>By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his bones.</p>
                <p>By faith Moses’ parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict.</p>
                <p>By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. By faith he kept the Passover and the application of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.</p>
                <p>By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.</p>
                <p>By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the army had marched around them for seven days.</p>
                <p>By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.</p>
                <p>And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson and Jephthah, about David and Samuel and the prophets, who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. Women received back their dead, raised to life again. There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection. Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were put to death by stoning; they were sawed in two; they were killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated – the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and in holes in the ground.</p>
                <p>These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised, since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.</p>
              </div>
            <p>You may be convinced of your own view of the world, and I totally respect that. But I'm here to tell you - there is something very unique about the love and relationship provided by Jesus Christ, there is something very special about pure and real faith in Him, and, lest your soul turn to dust in some odd 80 years, I implore you to seek Him for yourself. What you really want - deep and resilient, undying love, righteous experience, clarity and understanding, pure desires - it's all found in Him.</p>
            <p>And because of this truth - I'm tellin' you - you're in a 3D life-size very realistic movie, my friend, and one day the credits will roll, and you will remember that you have been sitting in a theater <i>this entire time</i>, and you will be confronted with hard truths like "Was I the best protagonist I could be?" and "Did I tell a good story through my actions and words and life?" and "Did I do my part in the actual movie of <i>LIFE</i> writ large, or was I caught up drinking from wells that will run dry and kill me of thirst in the end?"</p>
            <p>And there will be many who rejoice in love and many who shriek in terror when the credits roll.</p>

    <h2><u>PART 4 - LUCIDITY THROUGH LIVIDITY</u></h2>
    <p>"The lucidity that was to constitute his torture at the same time crowns his victory."
      <p> - Albert Camus, <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>
    <p>With the rage of a thousand bulls, Sisyphus starts again - up his known mountain, every step strenuous, every direction asunder.</p>
    <p>Here's how it happened:</p>
    <p>I was strolling down a garden of decaying fruit when it struck me: Only something that is eternal can be truly meaningful.</p>
    <p>Only that which lasts actually matters.</p>
    <p>I was swept up in experience and then I perceived that experience does not live on - for death comes to all that experience. And so, I asked myself, for at the end of the day, all we have is ourselves, "What matters in the end?", bearing in mind that all experience ends and therefore does not appear to matter. I perceived that what was written may matter for what is written lives on past oneself. So I scribbled for days and days, thinking to myself, <i>I will write and write and people will know and feel what they read from me is good and true and to be listened to. Then they will see my heart for what it is, they will know the humanity within me and they will see me for who I am, not this odd robe of flesh I'm stuck in.</i> But then I found the Book of Truth and realized everything that needed to be said had been said and nothing newly written would ever achieve the insurmountable specialness that this Book of Truth, which is the Holy Bible, held. But I decided I may as well write anyway. But, behold, after I am dead and gone, and though my words may live on a little while longer, those future people will perish and their experience will be no more. And I hated life for I saw everything is done in vain. And I perceived that I was dust and to be returned to dust and I was not needed for people perished just fine on their own without me, and I was not necessary for God like He is for Himself and His people. No, I perceived what I was - a body of dust, full of an empty spirit, pining for water to live another day so that I could be thirsty so that I may find water again to live another day so that I could be thirsty so that I could live a nice bundle of days so that I could die. I could live a nice bundle of days engineered by God, and then keel over and die and be no more. And I hated life for having death and I hated people for not seeing the reality of death and nothing made sense any more for this is the message of the wisest man of earth: <b>All is vanity</b>. And so I became first despondent and then livid and then despondent again at the prospect of my pointlessness.
    </p>
    <p>And my memory was squashed by the weight of the world...</p>
    <p>And I perceived the frailty of the human mind and the weakness of the human heart and the vanity of myself, alone, to do good. And I wanted to never have known that such evil was possible in reality, even if that meant never having been born.</p>
    <p>I knew not whether it was better to gasp for air in this lifeless vortex or drown in some sort of sunken sorrow...</p>
    <p>For I saw then how all my ways were vanity, all my efforts fruitless, and my ultimate destiny out of my control.</p>
    <p>I cried out in despair:</p>
      <p>"Oh where, oh where is the rhyme and reason</p>
      <p>to Chaos and Mayhem which are my seasons?"</p>
    <p>But, the great truth of reality drew me in like a whirlpool...</p>
    <p>Behold, you see, I was fast asleep, but then I woke up from my vain slumber, for my Dad had called me to check in. I said I would be at His house earlier, but I stayed asleep because it is easy and natural.</p>
    <p>I loathe sleeping now, knowing that I could've been awake and alive and on my way to my Father's house.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>There once was a Father and His children. They were flying high above the earth and engaged in riveting conversation. They both gazed down upon the earth, and saw the flames of sin enveloping the midst of all people.</p>
    <p>The Father said to His child, "All the light that you see I give to you".</p>
    <p>The world said, eyes brimming with fear, "Where exactly?"</p>
    <p>And I said, <i><b><u>Why?</u></b></i></p>
    <p>And that has made all the difference.</p>
    <p>Because: You're a philosopher the moment you first ask "Why?"</p>
    <p>And through philosophical study, I determined:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The very fact that we are motivated to do anything (that we succumb to boredom so easily) is evidence that there is some sort of meaning to life (hence, the meaning of life cannot be nothing). Motivation, whether conscious or subconscious, is purpose. And we are all motivated to accomplish certain purposes. And the right kind of purpose is truly meaningful.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>If the meaning of life isn't, say, a phrase or a certain object. Then the fact that it's not <i>that specific thing</i> means that there is a meaning to life. If you can say "the meaning of life is not this specific object", then it follows that there is something that you can point to that <i>is</i> the meaning of life (even if, in your opinion, you point that meaning to nothing).</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>The meaning of Life is not me. So why would I make the meaning of <i>my</i> life about me? The meaning of my individual life ought to align with the meaning of the totality of Life, if indeed it can be done.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>All spectrums of experience are stretched too far for there not to be something greater than ourselves at work in our midst. Seriously, just look around. The complexity, the simplicity, the depth, the beauty of it all. If you see nothing worth being in awe about, you're missing something. Every experience that every human being has had is bathed in divine beauty - perceiving that underlying beauty is simply a matter of the heart.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>And so it dawned on me that there must be a grand meaning of life, for:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I knew that living for self-gain was curiously and totally in vain, so in order to pursue something of real merit or worth, one must pursue that something as selflessly as possible. In other words, there exists a peculiar specialness to doing selfless things and being selfless while the natural and easy thing to do is to live and act selfishly.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I knew there was a beauty that pervades all things, and I knew this beauty had to have come from somewhere. Total and complete randomness/lawlessness does not produce beauty - it produces chaos. Therefore, because there is beauty, there is at least some degree of order. For if there was no order to life, then how could any of it be beautiful?</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I had tasted real, upright, undying, lasting, sincere <i>goodness</i> - something that could not exist on its own in an evil world that was set to be extinguished forever.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>And so I was fascinated by all things and sought to understand myself, and the human condition, and the truth of our reality in full.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>"Almost nothing important that ever happens to you happens because you engineer it. Destiny has no beeper; destiny always leans trenchcoated out of an alley with some sort of psst that you usually can't even hear because you're in such a rush to or from something important that you've tried to engineer."</p>
      <p> - David Foster Wallace, <i>Infinite Jest</i></p>
    <p>I awoke and perceived some part of me had been stabbed. My heart, mightily punctured, bled its course. In the frenzy of bleeding out, I had a subconscious epiphany that I needed truth. So frantically I went through what was in front of me, confident that a syringe full of truth serum would fill my bleeding heart. I pounded on the door of the universe, demanding from the gutters of my throat, begging "Where are the truth serums? I know they are there! I demand truth! Give me truth!"</p>
    <p>If you didn't know the state of my heart, you'd think me an obnoxious loon.</p>
    <p>And lo and behold, through the eternal moments of silence that seemed to consume me, the universe did answer me.</p>
    <p>The universe responded to me.</p>
    <p>It pounded on the door of my mind, demanding from the heights of its voice, commanding, "Give me life! Give me life!"</p>
    <p>If you didn't know the depths of its love, you'd think the universe evil.</p>
    <p>And lo and behold, in exemplifying the very opposite of obnoxious evil, the universe kneeled to its knees and raised its arms up to me in proposal. And, consumed by the fire of love, the only true element of the universe, I said yes, and I gave the universe my life, and it gave me truth and all that that entails.</p>
    <p>And then it hit me.</p>
    <h3><b><i>I am blessed to perceive that all life is a love story being told by the Creator to His created.</i></b></h3>
    <p>And an abundance of other truths hit me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I perceived that I could stay in the system and talk and talk and talk or dropout and actually listen to people.</li>
      <li>*</li>
      <li>I perceived that all men and likewise myself sought to be understood and that it was the whole duty of mine to be a voice for the misunderstood. For too many are guilty of misunderstanding what ought to be understood. And what ought to be understood is this:
        <ul>
          <li>There is no act a man can commit that does not merit my forgiveness, especially when I know that the Lord forgives all sin for those that believe in Him.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>Love – of the true and pure and real sort - is imperative to have for all people in your life. It is imperative because of how good it is – both for the one loving and the loved ones.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>The intrinsic beauty of the moment is total and wonderful and worthy of a righteous and praiseworthy awe.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I perceived that you only fear something other than God if you don't comprehend the big picture. I perceived that you only fail to love and forgive someone if you don't know God and what He did for you, and the power of His love.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that all those who sought abortions had been born themselves, and, behold, the voice of the unborn was unheard, squashed by the souls of the selfish. For the born sought to destroy the unborn and did not know the evil that they committed, squashing the voices of the unborn – for if the unborn could speak, I have a hunch they would scream for life.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that the love of wealth and materialism in America stems from a certain love for life. Although it is horrifically unfounded, currently off course and off balance in a very morbid way.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that <i>all negative judgment stems from the insecurity of the judger that sees difference in the judged and, recognizing the multitude of differences between oneself and the other, in defense of what oneself is, deems the judged in a negative light to reassure themselves that what they are doing and who they are is in a positive light</i>. For who are we to know the mind and the heart of any individual but ourselves? And this common human occurrence begs a very real philosophical question – why are we drawn to paint ourselves in this positive light, even to such a degree that we feel compelled to tarnish the light of others?</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that all we do we do in order to have the best meal possible, the best experience within our reach, one that tastes out of this world, one that gives us the necessary fuel to accomplish whatever we set out to do, one that is shared with deeply close friends, one that is a celebration of life in its purest form. Then I knew that this meal of an experience was coming, and it had its time and place and guest list, and <b>right now the invitation is out, but the doors will slam shut at some point, for the master of the feast knows best when and how to entertain those that have accepted his call for love and life and wonderful community.</b></li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that I was unfit for conventionalism.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that all things that are not attached to eternity pass away forever and ultimately hold no value.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that all people want the same thing and it is our story as a people to pursue that same thing in different ways. One way really does lead to us having that thing. All others fall short.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that life is meant to be lived to the fullest and that there are many forces at play actively working to stop you from living life the way it is meant to be lived.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that even perception is fallible, like our hearts.</li>
        <li>*</li>
        <li>I perceived that <div class="markerfelt">fantasy</div> is the <div class="phosphate">truth</div> of this <div class="chalkduster">dream</div>
            <ul>
              <li>Define: Fantasy = the reality of imagination.</li>
              <li>Define: Imagination = the brain's freedom.</li>
              <li>Define: Freedom = anything you choose to describe it
                <ul>
                  <li>Therefore, the reality of the brain's choice is the truth of this dream. In other words, your reality will match however you <i>choose</i> to perceive reality, but pray that however you choose to perceive reality accurately correlates to <div class="phosphate">objective reality</div></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>And it was like, though the thunder roared around me and the rain poured ceaselessly, all I could see were these flashes of brilliance, these aphorisms of lightning, this internal clarity despite blatant external confusion. And this is what I saw:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We are here to be taught to trust God over ourselves. Because of sin, we trust the life that we make for ourselves instead of what is infinitely better, the life that God provides for us.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>Man is a little less evil when he stops gazing down with arrogance at the inadequacy of others and starts staring up with wonder at the beauty of the inadequacy of others and shouts with glee, "Truly you are superior! And at the very least, my equal!"</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>The biggest mistake in history was disobeying God. The biggest mistake we currently make is disobeying God.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>"Sex is what dogs do on the side of the street. The intimacy and love and connection I have with my wife when we make love cannot be called that." Sin seeks to convince you of the lie that indulging in sin is living life to the full when the true tragedy is that it is robbing you of that fullness. Fullness is lived God's way.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>I perceived that all human desire ends with emotional stimulus. Based on my experience and faith, I know God is what we all desire. We are meant to engage in relationship with God. And so we all strive for emotional stimulus that is, reflects, or is close to God. We all long for praise, no matter where it comes from. We all long to satisfy and act on things that lead to who we want to be. But that glory is selfish. And in the most humbling paradox of all, abandoning selfish aspirations will lead you to exactly what you thought those selfish aspirations would accomplish – life, love, success, wealth, health, fullness – whatever it is you truly desire - it is found in Jesus Christ and all given to you by Him according to His good will.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>There are two paths. One is accepting the grace of Jesus Christ and realizing that you will never be good enough on your own and that you need God to be good. The other is that you worship some other idol that lies to you and claims that if you work or do or be a certain way, then you are good enough or that you will then be satisfied. One is the path of truth and God. The other is the path of lies and the self. How long will it take each of us to realize that on our own we go nowhere and do no good thing? You either live for God or you live for yourself. One of those will lead to life. The other death.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>This is the life that Jesus yearns to give us: a life consumed by beautiful livelihood, fullness of love, and betterment of self.</li>
        </ul
        <p>***</p>
        <p>I am imperfect and have sinned many times. In truth, I do not know people like my Father - like not even close - and therefore it is imperative that I refrain from judgment upon all others, and espouse love, like my Father has said. But in loving the Father, we inevitably come to follow His commandments.</p>
        <p>And so with love in mind, consider these:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Just like scientific theories are models that have not been thwarted by experimentation, so too does the literature of the bible stand up to my reality. And of course, inevitably, surpasses so much more.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>Sure, the message of novels can be summed up to be a sentence or two. But hearing a sentence doesn’t even scrape the surface of understanding that your mind can handle. A novel allows the message to not just be severely unknown, but allows it to soak in the mind, leading to knowing the true weight of that slender sentence summary. The same rule applies to why we live a lifetime and not a moment. It's simply better to learn from a lifetime than a moment.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>The meaning of anything is whatever the creator of that something wants it to be. Yes, interpreters are free to interpret. But that does not change the original and authoritative intention of the created piece.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>It's like I woke up from a trance, excited to realize that I had been performing on a stage for a nonexistent audience, and eager to step off stage to a truer reality. Humbled by my awakening, I yearned to call back to my colleagues on stage and scream at them the truth: "You're acting!!! You're performing!!! Can't you see that you have given yourself into some vain game that has sought to control your mind and tragically succeeded? What are you seeking when you do well at the games in your head?" But, alas, no words could reach them, for uncovered fears roamed the caverns of their mind and held tight to the reigns of their will, convincing them to play a false role on a fake stage, despite truth being in them and around them, mere steps away. Saddened by the blindness of the world, I exited stage left and hurried home to true love.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>Life is like a roller coaster. And we can see the roller coasters of others. I am turning my attention away from the roller coasters of others and focusing on my own ride. And only then will I be able to fully enjoy it!</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>And I dreamt that some generation would come from the shadows and save us and sanctify us but behold no one came because no one knows, no, not one, but Him. And I perceived that I could do nothing but change myself, although I wanted every person I met to share in this secret joy that came from the Lord. All I can do is nudge, is put up a sign, is write the message that I believe in. And those that want to hear truth will work to understand truth and those that want to be confused or comfortable in their own ways will remain so.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>I know that life is a puzzle. And year by year, I am slowly accumulating the pieces, and in some decade, by God, I am going to put enough of the pieces of the puzzle together, not to complete it, but to get the gist of the picture.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>The Creator of the universe knocks on one's door. And they slam it in His face.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>When a book is written, it is constant and unchanging in its truth. What shifts is the mind of the interpreter upon digesting the book, not the book itself. The book is still objectively true, although there are perceived subjective truths about it. So it is with the bible.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>You can't quantify something that invented quantity as we know it.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>How fascinating is it that no matter what we think, say, or do, we have a philosophy, our very own worldview, that we employ as we live out our lives…</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>Life is absurd? Of course life is absurd - without God. With God, life is nothing but gorgeous. Not choosing God is absurd. Anything without God is absurd. Think of the futility of life without God, how all your experience is null post-death, and you will realize how He is the only thing that is sensible.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>Religion is a crutch for the weak? God is created for human needs?...These accusations are amiss. You may die with your pride and your illusion of freedom while I will live with my God. Oh but this is such a loaded thought – for it is not religion I have found, it is relationship, and my past life dwelling in sin was my crutch for reality but now I have no need to lean on any of that for God makes me upright and always strong in Him. I correct your statement here: Sin is a crutch for the dying. And the uniform qualities of human needs point to the God-sized hole in each of our hearts.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>We live in a utopia already. Due to the power of our mind that has been given to us, whatever we seek, we will find. Whatever we want, we will have. You claim that your wants and desires are not met in this world? You naïve sloth. If you truly wanted something, then you would find it. What is everyone's dilemma is that they think that they know what they want (sin), when in reality what they truly want is quite different (God).</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>If genuine life advice sounds cliché, that's because the best way to go about life has been uncovered. Do you really think that over the course of all human lives, no one is yet to understand it succinctly, life's inner workings to only be revealed when you showed up through some "original" and "creative" new-age aphorism? Nothing is new under the sun. People have died believing in the truth. People have died believing in lies. People are living today believing in the truth. People are living today believing in lies.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>I have walked down the same road my entire life. Everything has been recognizable. But I am not dismayed at how you think it is all the same because of who I walk down the road with. That is the difference between you and me. I want you to know my companion, for he makes everything glisten with newness. My friend that leads me down this straightforward road makes every flower smell greater than the one before, every step more fulfilling than the last, every breath more present than the fleeting past.</li>
          <li>*</li>
          <li>First, as children we know nothing. But then we learn how to behave from our surroundings. How to go our own way. And a constant and consistent battle in our being is justifying ourselves. We need validation from somewhere, and we behave in a certain way to obtain that which we so desperately need. Perhaps true adulthood is forgiving others and likewise ourselves as we all trip and fall on our way to peaceful validation, and letting everyone swim their own stroke, however far they wish, not criticizing them for being unlike our specific stroke and length, but rather just being sure they don't drown.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And there is a sweet irony right here and throughout all of this. All that I despise about society and the world and the evil I've witnessed in others I must forgive, because all the evil in the world that I find despicable is also within me.</p>
        <p>And now I borrow a passage from the brilliant mind of W. Somerset Maugham, which shines more light on the message of lucidity I wish to share with you.</p>

        <div class="STZhongsong">
        <h3><i>CHAPTER TWO</i></h3>
        <p><i>(i)</i></p>
        <p>I DID not see Elliott till he came to London towards the end of June in the following year. I asked him whether Larry had after all gone to Paris. He had. I was faintly amused at Elliott's exasperation with him.</p>
        <p>"I had a kind of sneaking sympathy for the boy. I couldn't blame him for wanting to spend a couple of years in Paris and I was prepared to launch him. I told him to let me know the moment he arrived, but it was only when Louisa wrote and told me he was there that I knew he'd come. I wrote to him care of the American Express, which was the address she gave me, and asked him to come and dine to meet some of the people I thought he ought to know; I thought I'd try him out first with the Franco-American set, Emily de Montadour and Gracie de Chateau-Gaillard and so on, and d'you know what he answered? He said he was sorry he couldn't come, but he hadn't brought any evening clothes with him."</p>
        <p>Elliott looked me full in the face to see the stupefaction with which he expected this communication to fill me. He raised a supercilious eyebrow when he observed that I took it with calm.</p>
        <p>"He replied to my letter on a sheet of nasty paper with the heading of a cafe in the Latin Quarter and when I wrote back I asked him to let me know where he was staying. I felt I must do something about him for Isabel's sake, and I thought perhaps he was shy—I mean I couldn't believe that any young fellow in his senses could come to Paris without evening clothes, and in any case there are tolerable tailors there, so I asked him to lunch and said it would be quite a small party, and would you believe it, not only did he ignore my request to give me some other address than the American Express, but he said he never ate luncheon. That finished him as far as I was concerned."</p>
        <p>"I wonder what he's been doing with himself."</p>
        <p>"I don't know, and to tell you the truth I don't care.</p>
        <p>I'm afraid he's a thoroughly undesirable young man and I think it would be a great mistake for Isabel to marry him. After all, if he led a normal sort of life I'd have ran across him at the Ritz bar or at Fouquet's or somewhere."</p>
        <p>I go sometimes to these fashionable places myself, but I go to others also, and it happened that I spent several days in Paris early in the autumn of that year on my way to Marseilles, where I was proposing to take one of the Messagerie ships for Singapore. I dined one evening with friends in Montparaasse and after dinner we went to the Dome to drink a glass of beer. Presently my wandering eye caught sight of Larry sitting by himself at a little marble-topped table on the crowded terrace. He was looking idly at the people who strolled up and down enjoying the coolness of the night after a sultry day. I left my party and went up to him. His face lit up when he saw me and he gave me an engaging smile. He asked me to sit down, but I said I couldn't as I was with a party.</p>
        <p>"I just wanted to say how d'you do to you," I said.</p>
        <p>"Are you staying here?" he asked.</p>
        <p>"Only for a very few days."</p>
        <p>"Will you lunch with me tomorrow?"</p>
        <p>"I thought you never lunched."</p>
        <p>He chuckled.</p>
        <p>"You've seen Elliott. I don't generally, I can't afford the time, I just have a glass of milk and a brioche, but I'd like you to dine with me."</p>
        <p>"All right."</p>
        <p>We arranged to meet at the Dome next day to have an aperitif and eat at some place on the boulevard. I rejoined my friends. We sat on talking. When next I looked for Larry he had gone.</p>

        <p><i>(ii)</i></p>
        <p>I spent the next morning very pleasantly. I went to the Luxembourg and passed an hour looking at some pictures I liked. Then I strolled in the gardens, recapturing the memories of my youth. Nothing had changed. They might have been the same students who walked along the gravel paths in pairs, eagerly discussing the writers who excited them. They might have been the same children who trundled the same hoops under the watchful eyes of the same nurses. They might have been the same old men who basked in the sunshine, reading the morning paper.</p>
        <p>They might have been the same middle-aged women in mourning who sat on the free benches and gossiped with one another about the price of food and the misdeeds of servants. Then I went to the Odeon and looked at the new books in the galleries and I saw the lads who like myself thirty years before were trying under the petulant eyes of the smock-frocked attendants to read as much as they could of books they could not afford to buy. Then I strolled leisurely along those dear, dingy streets till I came to the Boulevard du Montparnasse and so to the Dome. Larry was waiting. We had a drink and walked along to a restaurant where we could lunch in the open air.</p>
        <p>He was perhaps a little paler than I remembered him and this made his very dark eyes, in their deep orbits, more striking; but he had the same self-possession, curious in one so young, and the same ingenuous smile. When he ordered his lunch I noticed that he spoke French fluently and with a good accent. I congratulated him on it.</p>
        <p>"I knew a certain amount of French before, you know," he explained. "Aunt Louisa had a French governess for Isabel, and when they were at Marvin she used to make us talk French with her all the time."</p>
        <p>I asked him how he liked Paris.</p>
        <p>"Very much."</p>
        <p>"D'you live in Montparnasse?"</p>
        <p>"Yes," he said, after a moment's hesitation which I interpreted into a disinclination to tell exactly where he lived.</p>
        <p>"Elliott was rather put out that the only address you gave was the American Express."</p>
        <p>Larry smiled but did not answer.</p>
        <p>"What do you do with yourself all the time?"</p>
        <p>"I loaf."</p>
        <p>"And you read?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, I read."</p>
        <p>"Do you ever hear from Isabel?"</p>
        <p>"Sometimes. We're neither of us great letter-writers. She's having a grand time in Chicago. They're coming over next year to stay with Elliott."</p>
        <p>"That'll be nice for you."</p>
        <p>"I don't believe Isabel's ever been to Paris. It'll be fun taking her around."</p>
        <p>He was curious to know about my journey in China and listened attentively to what I told him; but when I tried to get him to talk about himself, I failed. He was so uncommunicative that I was forced to the conclusion that he had asked me to lunch with him merely to enjoy my company. I was pleased, but baffled. We had no sooner finished our coffee than he called for the bill, paid it and got up.</p>
        <p>"Well, I must be off," he said.</p>
        <p>We parted. I knew no more of what he was up to than before. I did not see him again.</p>

        <p><i>(iii)</i></p>
        <p>I was not in Paris in the spring when, sooner than they had planned, Mrs. Bradley and Isabel arrived to stay with Elliott; and again I have to eke out my knowledge of what passed during the few weeks they spent there by the exercise of my imagination. They landed at Cherbourg and Elliott, always considerate, went to meet them. They passed through the customs. The train started. Elliott with some complacency told them that he had engaged a very good lady's maid to look after them and when Mrs. Bradley said that was quite unnecessary, since they didn't need one, he was very sharp with her.</p>
        <p>"Don't be tiresome the moment you arrive, Louisa. No one can be well turned out without a maid, and I've engaged Antoinette not only for your sake and Isabel's but for mine. It would mortify me that you shouldn't be perfectly dressed."</p>
        <p>He gave the clothes they were wearing a disparaging glance.</p>
        <p>"Of course you'll want to buy some new frocks. On mature consideration I've come to the conclusion that you can't do better than Chanel."</p>
        <p>"I always used to go to Worth," said Mrs. Bradley.</p>
        <p>She might as well not have spoken, for he took no notice.</p>
        <p>"I've talked to Chanel myself and I've made an appointment for you tomorrow at three. Then there are hats. Obviously Reboux."</p>
        <p>"I don't want to spend a lot of money, Elliott."</p>
        <p>"I know. I am proposing to pay for everything myself. I'm determined that you shall be a credit to me. Oh, and Louisa, I've arranged several parties for you and I've told my French friends that Myron was an ambassador, which, of course, he would have been if he'd lived a little longer, and it makes a better effect. I don't suppose it'll come up, but I thought I'd better warn you."</p>
        <p>"You're ridiculous, Elliott."</p>
        <p>"No, I'm not. I know the world. I know that the widow of an ambassador has more prestige than the widow of a minister." As the train steamed into the Gare du Nord, Isabel, who was standing at the window, called out: "There's Larry."</p>
        <p> It had hardly stopped when she sprang out and ran to meet him. He threw his arms around her.</p>
        <p>"How did he know you were coming?" Elliott asked his sister acidly.</p>
        <p>"Isabel wirelessed him from the ship."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley kissed him affectionately, and Elliott gave him a limp hand to shake. It was ten o'clock at night.</p>
        <p>"Uncle Elliott, can Larry come to lunch tomorrow?" cried Isabel, her arm in the young man's, her face eager and her eyes shining.</p>
        <p>"I should be charmed, but Larry has given me to understand that he doesn't eat lunch."</p>
        <p>"He will tomorrow, won't you, Larry?"</p>
        <p>"I will," he smiled.</p>
        <p>"I shall look forward to seeing you at one o'clock then."</p>
        <p>He stretched out his hand once more, intending to dismiss him, but Larry grinned at him impudently.</p>
        <p>"I'll help with the luggage and get a cab for you."</p>
        <p>"My car is waiting and my man will see to the luggage," said Elliott with dignity.</p>
        <p>"That's fine. Then all we've got to do is to go. If there's room for me I'll come as far as your door with you."</p>
        <p>"Yes, do, Larry," said Isabel.</p>
        <p>They walked down the platform together, followed by Mrs. Bradley and Elliott. Elliott's face bore a look of frigid disapproval.</p>
        <p>"Quelles manières," he said to himself, for in certain circumstances he felt he could express his sentiments more forcibly in French.</p>
        <p>Next morning at eleven, having finished dressing, for he was not an early riser, he sent a note to his sister, via his man Joseph and her maid Antoinette, to ask her to come to the library so that they could have a talk. When she appeared he closed the door carefully and, putting a cigarette into an immensely long agate holder, lit it and sat down.</p>
        <p>"Am I to understand that Isabel and Larry are still engaged?" he asked.</p>
        <p>"So far as I know."</p>
        <p>"I'm afraid I haven't a very good account to give you of the young man." He told her then how he had been prepared to launch him in society and the plans he had made to establish him in a fit and proper manner. "I even had my eye on a rez-de-chaussée that would have been the very thing for him. It belongs to the young Marquis de Rethel and he wanted to sublet it because he'd been appointed to the embassy at Madrid."</p>
        <p>But Larry had refused his invitations in a manner that made it quite clear that he did not want his help.</p>
        <p>"What the object of coming to Paris is if you're not going to take advantage of what Paris has to give you is beyond my comprehension. I don't know what he does with himself. He doesn't seem to know anybody. Do you know where he lives?"</p>
        <p>"The only address we've ever had is the American Express."</p>
        <p>"Like a travelling salesman or a school-teacher on vacation, I shouldn't be surprised if he was living with some little trollop in a studio in Montmartre."</p>
        <p>"Oh, Elliott."</p>
        <p>"What other explanation can there be for the mystery he's making of his dwelling place and for his refusal to consort with people of his own class?"</p>
        <p>"It doesn't sound like Larry. And last night, didn't you get the impression that he was just as much in love with Isabel as ever? He couldn't be so false."</p>
        <p>Elliott by a shrug of the shoulders gave her to understand that there was no limit to the duplicity of men.</p>
        <p>"What about Gray Maturin? Is he still in the picture?"</p>
        <p>"He'd marry Isabel tomorrow if she'd have him."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley told him then why they had to come to Europe sooner than they had at first intended. She had found herself in ill-health, and the doctors had informed her that she was suffering from diabetes. It was not serious, and by attention to her diet and taking moderate doses of insulin there was no reason why she should not live for a good many years, but the knowledge that she had an incurable disease made her anxious to see Isabel settled. They had talked the matter over. Isabel was sensible. She had agreed that if Larry refused to come back to Chicago at the end of the two years in Paris they had agreed upon and get a job, there was only one thing to do and that was to break with him. But it offended Mrs. Bradley's sense of personal dignity that they should wait till the appointed time and then come to fetch him, like a fugitive from justice, back to his own country. She felt that Isabel would put herself in a humiliating position. But it was very natural that they should spend the summer in Europe, where Isabel had not been since she was a child. After their visit in Paris they could go to some watering-place suitable to Mrs. Bradley's complaint, then on to the Austrian Tyrol for a while and from there travel slowly through Italy. Mrs. Bradley's intention was to ask Larry to accompany them, so that he and Isabel could see whether the long separation had left their feelings unchanged. It would be manifest in due course whether Larry, having had his fling, was prepared to accept the responsibilities of life.
        </p>
        <p>"Henry Maturin was sore with him for turning down the position he offered him, but Gray has talked him round, and he can go into the business the moment he comes back to Chicago."</p>
        <p>"Gray's a very nice fellow."</p>
        <p>"He certainly is." Mrs. Bradley sighed. "I know he'd make Isabel happy."</p>
        <p>Elliott then told her what parties he had arranged for them. He was giving a big luncheon on the following day and at the end of the week; a grand dinner party. He was taking them to a reception at the Château-Gaillards and he had got cards for them to a ball that the Rothschilds were giving.</p>
        <p>"You'll ask Larry, won't you?"</p>
        <p>"He tells me he hasn't any evening clothes," Elliott sniffed.</p>
        <p>"Well, ask him all the same. After all, he is a nice boy, and it wouldn't help to give him the cold shoulder. It would only make Isabel obstinate."</p>
        <p>"Of course I'll ask him if you wish it."</p>
        <p>Larry came to lunch at the appointed time, and Elliott, whose manners were admirable, was pointedly cordial to him. It was not difficult, since Larry was so gay, in such high spirits that it would have needed a much more ill-natured man than Elliott not to be charmed with him. The conversation dealt with Chicago and their common friends there, so that there was not much for Elliott to do other than to look amiable and pretend to be interested in the concerns of persons whom he thought of no social consequence. He did not mind listening; indeed, he thought it rather touching to hear them tell of this young couple's engagement, that young couple's marriage, and another young couple's divorce. Who had ever heard of them? He knew that that pretty little Marquise de Clinchant had tried to poison herself because her lover, the Prince de Colombey, had left her to marry the daughter of a South American millionaire. That was something to talk about. Looking at Larry, he was obliged to admit that there was something peculiarly attractive in him; with his deep-set strangely black eyes, his high cheekbones, pale skin and mobile mouth he reminded Elliott of a portrait by Botticelli, and it occurred to him that if he were dressed in the costume of the period he would look extravagantly romantic. He remembered his notion of getting him off with a distinguished Frenchwoman and he smiled slyly on reflecting that he was expecting at dinner on Saturday Marie Louise de Florimond, who combined irreproachable connections with notorious immorality. She was forty, but looked ten years younger; she had the delicate beauty of her ancestress painted by Nattier which, owing to Elliott himself, now hung in one of the great American collections; and her sexual voracity was insatiable. Elliott decided to put Larry next to her. He knew she would waste no time in making her desires clear to him. He had already invited a young attaché at the British Embassy whom he thought Isabel might like. Isabel was very pretty, and as he was an Englishman, and well off, it wouldn't matter that she had no fortune. Mellowed by the excellent Montrachet with which they had started lunch and by the fine Bordeaux that followed, Elliott thought with tranquil pleasure of the possibilities that presented themselves to his mind. If things turned out as he thought they very well might, dear Louisa would have no more cause for anxiety. She had always slightly disapproved of him; poor dear, she was very provincial; but he was fond of her. It would be a satisfaction to him to arrange everything for her by help of his knowledge of the world.
        </p>
        <p>To waste no time, Elliott had arranged to take his ladies to look at clothes immediately after lunch, so as they got up from table he intimated to Larry with the tact of which he was a master that he must make himself scarce, but at the same time he asked him with pressing affability to come to the two grand parties he had arranged. He need hardly have taken so much trouble, since Larry accepted both invitations with alacrity.</p>
        <p>But Elliott's plan failed. He was relieved when Larry appeared at the dinner party in a very presentable dinner-jacket, for he had been a little nervous that he would wear the same blue suit that he had worn at lunch; and after dinner, getting Marie Louise de Florimond into a corner, he asked her how she had liked his young American friend. "He has nice eyes and good teeth."</p>
        <p>"Is that all? I put him beside you because I thought he was just your cup of tea."</p>
        <p>She looked at him suspiciously.</p>
        <p>"He told me he was engaged to your pretty niece."</p>
        <p>"Voyons, ma chère, the fact that a man belongs to another woman has never prevented you from taking him away from her if you could."</p>
        <p>"Is that what you want me to do? Well, I'm not going to do your dirty work for you, my poor Elliott."</p>
        <p>Elliott chuckled.</p>
        <p>"The meaning of that, I presume, is that you tried your stuff and found there was nothing doing."</p>
        <p>"Why I like you, Elliott, is that you have the morals of a bawdy-house keeper. You don't want him to marry your niece. Why not? He is well bred and quite charming. But he's really too innocent. I don't think he had the least suspicion of what I meant."</p>
        <p>"You should have been more explicit, dear friend."</p>
        <p>"I have enough experience to know when I'm wasting my time. The fact is that he has eyes only for your little Isabel, and between you and me, she has twenty years advantage over me. And she's sweet."</p>
        <p>"Do you like her dress? I chose it for her myself."</p>
        <p>"It's pretty and it's suitable. But of course she has no chic." Elliott took this as a reflection on himself, and he was not prepared to let Madame de Florimond get away without a dig. He smiled genially.</p>
        <p>"One has to have reached your ripe maturity to have your chic, dear friend," he said,</p>
        <p>Madame de Florimond wielded a bludgeon rather than a rapier. Her retort made Elliott's Virginian blood boil.</p>
        <p>"But I'm sure that in your fair land of gangsters [votre beau pays d'apaches] they will hardly miss something that is so subtle and so inimitable."</p>
        <p>But if Madame de Florimond carped, the rest of Elliott's friends were delighted both with Isabel and with Larry. They liked her fresh prettiness. her abounding health and her vitality; they liked his picturesque appearance, his good manners and his quiet, ironic humour. Both had the advantage of speaking good and fluent French. Mrs. Bradley, after living so many years in diplomatic circles, spoke it correctly enough but with an unabashed American accent. Elliott entertained them lavishly. Isabel, pleased with her new clothes and her new hats, amused by all the gaiety Elliott provided and happy to be with Larry, thought she had never enjoyed herself so much.</p>
        <p>Elliott was of opinion that breakfast was a meal that you should share only with total strangers, and then only if there was no help for it, so Mrs. Bradley, somewhat against her will, and Isabel, far from displeased, were obliged to have theirs in their bedrooms. But Isabel, when she awoke, sometimes told Antoinette the grand maid Elliott had engaged for them, to take her café au lait into her mother's room so that she could talk to her while she had it. In the busy life she led it was the only moment of the day in which she could be alone with her. One such morning, when they had been in Paris nearly a month, after Isabel had done narrating the events of the previous night, most of which she and Larry had spent going the round of the night clubs with a party of friends, Mrs. Bradley let fall the question she had had in mind to ask ever since their arrival.</p>
        <p>"When is he coming back to Chicago?"</p>
        <p>"I don't know. He hasn't spoken of it."</p>
        <p>"Haven't you asked him?"</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"Are you scared to?"</p>
        <p>"No, of course not."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley, lying on a chaise longue, in a modish dressing-gown that Elliott had insisted on giving her, was polishing her nails. "What do you talk about all the time when you're alone?"</p>
        <p>"We don't talk all the time. It's nice to be together. You know, Larry was always rather silent. When we talk I think I do most of the talking."</p>
        <p>"What has he been doing with himself?"</p>
        <p>"I don't really know. I don't think anything very much. I suppose he's been having a good time."</p>
        <p>"And where is he living?"</p>
        <p>"I don't know that either."</p>
        <p>"He seems very reticent, doesn't he?"</p>
        <p>Isabel lit a cigarette and, as she blew a cloud of smoke from her nostrils, looked coolly at her mother.</p>
        <p>"What exactly do you mean by that, Mamma?"</p>
        <p>"Your uncle Elliott thinks he has an apartment and is living there with a woman."</p>
        <p>Isabel burst out laughing.</p>
        <p>"You don't believe that, do you?"</p>
        <p>"No. I honestly don't." Mrs. Bradley looked reflectively at her nails. "Don't you ever talk to him about Chicago?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, a lot."</p>
        <p>"Hasn't he given any sort of indication that he intends to come back?"</p>
        <p>"I can't say he has."</p>
        <p>"He will have been gone two years next October."</p>
        <p>"I know."</p>
        <p>"Well, it's your business, dear, and you must do what you think right. But things don't get any easier by putting them off." She glanced at her daughter, but Isabel would not meet her eyes. Mrs. Bradley gave her an affectionate smile. "If you don't want to be late for lunch you'd better go and have your bath."</p>
        <p>"I'm lunching with Larry. We're going to some place in the Latin Quarter."</p>
        <p>"Enjoy yourself."</p>
        <p>An hour later Larry came to fetch her. They took a cab to the Pont St. Michel and sauntered up the crowded boulevard till they came to a café they liked the look of. They sat down on the terrace and ordered a couple of Dubonnets. Then they took another cab and went to a restaurant. Isabel had a healthy appetite and she enjoyed the good things Larry ordered for her. She enjoyed looking at the people sitting cheek by jowl with them, for the place was packed, and it made her laugh to see the intense pleasure they so obviously took in their food; but she enjoyed above all sitting at a tiny table alone with Larry. She loved the amusement in his eyes while she chattered away gaily. It was enchanting to feel so much at home with him. But at the back of her mind was a vague disquiet, for though he seemed very much at home too, she felt it was not so much with her as with the surroundings. She had been faintly disturbed by what her mother had said, and though seeming to prattle so guilelessly she observed his every expression. He was not quite the same as when he had left Chicago, but she couldn't tell in what the difference lay. He looked exactly as she remembered him, as young, as frank, but his expression was changed. It was not that he was more serious, his face in repose had always been serious, it had a calmness that was new to her; it was as though he had settled something with himself and were at ease in a way he had never been before.
        </p>
        <p>When they had finished lunch he suggested that they should take a stroll through the Luxembourg.</p>
        <p>"No, I don't want to go and look at pictures."</p>
        <p>"All right then, let's go and sit in the gardens."</p>
        <p>"No, I don't want to do that either. I want to go and see where you live."</p>
        <p>"There's nothing to see. I live in a scrubby little room in a hotel."</p>
        <p>"Uncle Elliott says you've got an apartment and are living in sin with an artist's model."</p>
        <p>"Come on then and see for yourself," he laughed. "It's only a step from here. We can walk."</p>
        <p>He took her through narrow, torturous streets, dingy notwithstanding the streak of blue sky that showed between the high houses, and after a while stopped at a small hotel with a pretentious façade.</p>
        <p>"Here we are."</p>
        <p>Isabel followed him into a narrow hall, on one side of which was a desk and behind it a man in shirt-sleeves, with a waistcoat in thin black and yellow stripes and a dirty apron, reading a paper. Larry asked for his key, and the man handed it to him from the rack immediately behind him. He gave Isabel an inquisitive glance that turned into a knowing smirk. It was clear that he thought she was going to Larry's room for no honest purpose.</p>
        <p>They climbed up two flights of stairs, on which was a threadbare red carpet, and Larry unlocked his door. Isabel entered a smallish room with two windows. They looked out on the grey apartment house opposite, on the ground floor of which was a stationer's shop. There was a single bed in the room, with a night table beside it, a heavy wardrobe with a large mirror, an upholstered but straight-backed armchair and a table between the windows on which were a typewriter, papers and a number of books. The chimney-piece was piled with paper-bound volumes.</p>
        <p>"You sit in the armchair. It's not very comfortable but it's the best I can offer."</p>
        <p>He drew up another chair and sat down.</p>
        <p>"Is this where you live?" asked Isabel.</p>
        <p>He chuckled at the look on her face.</p>
        <p>"It is. I've been here ever since I came to Paris."</p>
        <p>"But why?"</p>
        <p>"It's convenient. It's near the Bibliothèque Nationale and the Sorbonne." He pointed to a door she had not noticed. "It's got a bathroom. I can get breakfast here and I generally dine at that restaurant where we had lunch."</p>
        <p>"It's awfully sordid."</p>
        <p>"Oh no, it's all right. It's all I want."</p>
        <p>"But what sort of people live here?"</p>
        <p>"Oh, I don't know. Up in the attics a few students. Two or three old bachelors in government offices and a retired actress at the Odéon; the only other room with a bath is occupied by a kept woman whose gentleman friend comes to see her every other Thursday; I suppose a few transients. It's a very quiet and respectable place."</p>
        <p>Isabel was a trifle disconcerted and because she knew Larry noticed it and was amused she was half inclined to take offence.</p>
        <p>"What's that great big book on the table?" she asked.</p>
        <p>"That? Oh, that's my Greek dictionary."</p>
        <p>"Your what?" she cried,</p>
        <p>"It's all right. It won't bite you."</p>
        <p>"Are you learning Greek?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>"I thought I’d like to."</p>
        <p>He was looking at her with a smile in his eyes and she smiled back at him.</p>
        <p>"Don't you think you might tell me what you've been up to all the time you've been in Paris?"</p>
        <p>"I've been reading a good deal. Eight or ten hours a day. I've attended lectures at the Sorbonne. I think I've read everything that's important in French literature and I can read Latin, at least Latin prose, almost as easily as I can read French. Of course Greek's more difficult. But I have a very good teacher. Until you came here I used to go to him three evenings a week."</p>
        <p>"And what is that going to lead to?"</p>
        <p>"The acquisition of knowledge," he smiled.</p>
        <p>"It doesn't sound very practical."</p>
        <p>"Perhaps it isn't and on the other hand perhaps it is. But it's enormous fun. You can't imagine what a thrill it is to read the Odyssey in the original. It makes you feel as if you only had to get on tiptoe and stretch out your hands to touch the stars."</p>
        <p>He got up from his chair, as though impelled by an excitement that seized him, and walked up and down the small room.</p>
        <p>"I've been reading Spinoza the last month or two. I don't suppose I understand very much of it yet, but it fills me with exultation. It's like landing from your plane on a great plateau in the mountains. Solitude, and an air so pure that it goes to your head like wine and you feel like a million dollars."</p>
        <p>"When are you coming back to Chicago?"</p>
        <p>"Chicago? I don't know. I haven't thought of it."</p>
        <p>"You said that if you hadn't got what you wanted after two years you'd give it up as a bad job."</p>
        <p>"I couldn't go back now. I'm on the threshold. I see vast lands of the spirit stretching out before me, beckoning, and I'm eager to travel them."</p>
        <p>"What do you expect to find in them?"</p>
        <p>"The answers to my questions." He gave her a glance that was almost playful, so that except that she knew him so well, she might have thought he was speaking in jest. "I want to make up my mind whether God is or God is not. I want to find out why evil exists. I want to know whether I have an immortal soul or whether when I die it's the end."</p>
        <p>Isabel gave a little gasp. It made her uncomfortable to hear Larry say such things, and she was thankful that he spoke so lightly, in the tone of ordinary conversation, that it was possible for her to overcome her embarrassment.</p>
        <p>"But Larry," she smiled. "People have been asking those questions for thousands of years. If they could be answered, surely they'd have been answered by now."</p>
        <p>Larry chuckled.</p>
        <p>"Don't laugh as if I'd said something idiotic," she said sharply.</p>
        <p>"On the contrary I think you've said something shrewd. But on the other hand you might say that if men have been asking them for thousands of years it proves that they can't help asking them and have to go on asking them. Besides, it's not true that no one has found the answers. There are more answers than questions, and lots of people have found answers that were perfectly satisfactory for them. Old Ruysbroek for instance."</p>
        <p>"Who was he?"</p>
        <p>"Oh, just a guy I didn't know at college," Larry answered flippantly.</p>
        <p>Isabel didn't know what he meant, but passed on.</p>
        <p>"It all sounds so adolescent to me. Those are the sort of things sophomores get excited about and then when they leave college they forget about them. They have to earn a living."</p>
        <p>"I don't blame them. You see, I'm in the happy position that I have enough to live on. If I hadn't I'd have had to do like everybody else and make money."</p>
        <p>"But doesn't money mean anything to you?"</p>
        <p>"Not a thing," he grinned.</p>
        <p>"How long d'you think all this is going to take you?"</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't know. Five years. Ten years."</p>
        <p>"And after that? What are you going to do with all this wisdom?"</p>
        <p>"If I ever acquire wisdom I suppose I shall be wise enough to know what to do with it."</p>
        <p>Isabel clasped her hands passionately and leant forwards in her chair.</p>
        <p>"You're so wrong, Larry. You're an American. Your place isn't here. Your place is in America."</p>
        <p>"I shall come back when I'm ready."</p>
        <p>"But you're missing so much. How can you bear to sit here in a backwater just when we're living through the most wonderful adventure the world has ever known? Europe's finished. We're the greatest, the most powerful people in the world. We're going forward by leaps and bounds. We've got everything. It's your duty to take part in the development of your country. You've forgotten, you don't know how thrilling life is in America today. Are you sure you're not doing this because you haven't the courage to stand up to the work that's before every American now? Oh, I know you're working in a way, but isn't it just an escape from your responsibilities? Is it more than just a sort of laborious idleness? What would happen to America if everyone shirked as you're shirking?"</p>
        <p>"You're very severe, honey," he smiled. "The answer to that is that everyone doesn't feel like me. Fortunately for themselves, perhaps, most people are prepared to follow the normal course; what you forget is that I want to learn as passionately as—Gray, for instance, wants to make pots of money. Am I really a traitor to my country because I want to spend a few years educating myself? It may be that when I'm through I shall have something to give that people will be glad to take. It's only a chance, of course, but if I fail I shall be no worse off than a man who's gone into business and hasn't made a go of it."</p>
        <p>"And what about me? Am I of no importance to you at all?"</p>
        <p>"You're of very great importance. I want you to marry me."</p>
        <p>"When? In ten years?"</p>
        <p>"No. Now. As soon as possible."</p>
        <p>"On what? Mamma can't afford to give me anything. Besides, she wouldn't if she could. She'd think it wrong to help you to live without doing anything."</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't want to take anything from your mother," said Larry. "I've got three thousand a year. That's plenty in Paris. We could have a little apartment and a bonne à tout faire. We'd have such a lark, darling."</p>
        <p>"But, Larry, one can't live on three thousand a year."</p>
        <p>"Of course one can. Lots of people live on much less."</p>
        <p>"But I don't want to live on three thousand a year. There's no reason why I should."</p>
        <p>"I've been living on half that."</p>
        <p>"But how!"</p>
        <p>She looked at the dingy little room with a shudder of distaste.</p>
        <p>"It means I've got a bit saved up. We could go down to Capri for our honeymoon and then in the fall we'd go to Greece. I'm crazy to go there. Don't you remember how we used to talk about travelling all over the world together?"</p>
        <p>"Of course I want to travel. But not like that. I don't want to travel second-class on steamships and put up at third-rate hotels, without a bathroom, and eat at cheap restaurants."</p>
        <p>"I went all through Italy last October like that. I had a wonderful time. We could travel all over the world on three thousand a year."</p>
        <p>"But I want to have babies, Larry."</p>
        <p>"That's all right. We'll take them along with us."</p>
        <p>"You're so silly," she laughed. "D'you know what it costs to have a baby? Violet Tomlinson had one last year and she did it as cheaply as she could and it cost her twelve hundred and fifty. And what d'you think a nurse costs?" She grew more vehement as one idea after another occurred to her. "You're so impractical. You don't know what you're asking me to do. I'm young, I want to have fun. I want to do all the things that people do. I want to go to parties, I want to go to dances, I want to play golf and ride horseback. I want to wear nice clothes. Can't you imagine what it means to a girl not to be as well dressed as the rest of her crowd? D'you know what it means, Larry, to buy your friends' old dresses when they're sick of them and be thankful when someone out of pity makes you a present of a new one? I couldn't even afford to go to a decent hairdresser to have my hair properly done. I don't want to go about in street-cars and omnibuses; I want to have my own car. And what d'you suppose I'd find to do with myself all day long while you were reading at the Library? Walk about the streets window-shopping or sit in the Luxembourg Garden seeing that my children didn't get into mischief? We wouldn't have any friends."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, Isabel," he interrupted.</p>
        <p>"Not the sort of friends I'm used to. Oh yes, Uncle Elliott's friends would ask us now and then for his sake, but we couldn't go because I wouldn't have the clothes to go in, and we wouldn't go because we couldn't afford to return their hospitality. I don't want to know a lot of scrubby, unwashed people; I've got nothing to say to them and they've got nothing to say to me. I want to live, Larry." She grew suddenly conscious of the look in his eyes, tender as it always was when fixed on her, but gently amused. "You think I'm silly, don't you? You think I'm being trivial and horrid."</p>
        <p>"No, I don't. I think what you say is very natural."</p>
        <p>He was standing with his back to the fireplace, and she got up and went up to him so that they were face to face. "Larry, if you hadn't a cent to your name and got a job that brought you in three thousand a year I'd marry you without a minute's hesitation. I'd cook for you, I'd make the beds, I wouldn't care what I wore, I'd go without anything, I'd look upon it as wonderful fun, because I'd know that it was only a question of time and you'd make good. But this means living in a sordid beastly way all our lives with nothing to look forward to. It means that I should be a drudge to the day of my death. And for what? So that you can spend years trying to find answers to questions that you say yourself are insoluble. It's so wrong. A man ought to work. That's what he's here for. That's how he contributes to the welfare of the community."</p>
        <p>"In short it's his duty to settle down in Chicago and enter Henry Maturin's business. Do you think that by getting my friends to buy the securities that Henry Maturin is interested in I should add greatly to the welfare of the community?"</p>
        <p>"There must be brokers and it's a perfectly decent and honourable way of earning a living."</p>
        <p>"You've drawn a very black picture of life in Paris on a moderate income. You know, it isn't really like that. One can dress very nicely without going to Chanel. And all the interesting people don't live in the neighbourhood of the Arc de Triomphe and the Avenue Foch. In fact few interesting people do, because interesting people generally don't have a lot of money. I know quite a number of people here, painters and writers and students, French, English, American, and what not, whom I think you'd find much more amusing than Elliott's seedy marquises and long-nosed duchesses. You've got a quick mind and a lively sense of humour. You'd enjoy hearing them swap ideas across the dinner table even though the wine was only vin ordinaire and you didn't have a butler and a couple of footmen to wait on you."</p>
        <p>"Don't be stupid, Larry. Of course I would. You know I'm not a snob. I'd love to meet interesting people."</p>
        <p>"Yes, in a Chanel dress. D'you think they wouldn't catch on to it that you looked upon it as a sort of cultured slumming? They wouldn't be at their ease, any more than you would, and you wouldn't get anything out of it except to tell Emily de Montadour and Gracie de Chateau-Gaillard afterwards what fun you'd had meeting a lot of weird bohemians in the Latin Quarter."</p>
        <p>Isabel slightly shrugged her shoulders.</p>
        <p>"I dare say you're right. They're not the sort of people I've been brought up with. They're not the sort of people I have anything in common with."</p>
        <p>"Where does that leave us?"</p>
        <p>"Just where we started. I've lived in Chicago ever since I can remember. All my friends are there. All my interests are there. I'm at home there. It's where I belong and it's where you belong. Mamma's ill and she's never going to get any better. I couldn't leave her even if I wanted to."</p>
        <p>"Does that mean that unless I'm prepared to come back to Chicago you don't want to marry me?"</p>
        <p>Isabel hesitated. She loved Larry. She wanted to marry him. She wanted him with all the power of her senses. She knew that he desired her. She couldn't believe that when it came to a showdown he wouldn't weaken. She was afraid, but she had to risk it.</p>
        <p>"Yes, Larry, that's just what it does mean."</p>
        <p>He struck a match on the chimney-piece, one of those old-fashioned French sulphur matches that fill your nostrils with an acrid odour, and lit his pipe. Then, passing her, he went over and stood by one of the windows. He looked out. He was silent for what seemed an endless time. She stood as she had stood before, when she was facing him, and looked in the mirror over the chimney-piece, but she did not see herself. Her heart was beating madly and she was sick with apprehension. He turned at last. "I wish I could make you see how much fuller the life I offer you is than anything you have a conception of. I wish I could make you see how exciting the life of the spirit is and how rich in experience. It's illimitable. It's such a happy life. There's only one thing like it, when you're up in a plane by yourself, high, high, and only infinity surrounds you. You're intoxicated by the boundless space. You feel such a sense of exhilaration that you wouldn't exchange it for all the power and glory in the world. I was reading Descartes the other day. The ease, the grace, the lucidity. Gosh!"
        </p>
        <p>"But Larry," she interrupted him desperately, "don't you see you're asking something of me that I'm not fitted for, that I'm not interested in and don't want to be interested in? How often have I got to repeat to you that I'm just an ordinary, normal girl, I'm twenty, in ten years I shall be old, I want to have a good time while I have the chance. Oh, Larry, I do love you so terribly. All this is just trifling. It's not going to lead you anywhere. For your own sake I beseech you to give it up. Be a man, Larry, and do a man's work. You're just wasting the precious years that others are doing so much with. Larry, if you love me you won't give me up for a dream. You've had your fling. Come back with us to America."</p>
        <p>"I can't, darling. It would be death to me. It would be the betrayal of my soul."</p>
        <p>"Oh, Larry, why d'you talk in that way? That's the way hysterical, highbrow women talk. What does it mean? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing."</p>
        <p>"It happens to mean exactly what I feel," he answered, his eyes twinkling.</p>
        <p>"How can you laugh? Don't you realize this is desperately serious? We've come to the cross-roads and what we do now is going to affect our whole lives."</p>
        <p>"I know that. Believe me, I'm perfectly serious."</p>
        <p>She sighed.</p>
        <p>"If you won't listen to reason there's nothing more to be said."</p>
        <p>"But I don't think it's reason. I think you've been talking the most terrible nonsense all the time."</p>
        <p>"I?" If she hadn't been so miserable she would have laughed. "My poor Larry, you're as crazy as a coot."</p>
        <p>She slowly slipped her engagement ring off her finger. She placed it on the palm of her hand and looked at it. It was a square-cut ruby set in a thin platinum band and she had always liked it.</p>
        <p>"If you loved me you wouldn't make me so unhappy."</p>
        <p>"I do love you. Unfortunately sometimes one can't do what one thinks is right without making someone else unhappy." She stretched out her hand on which the ruby was resting and forced a smile to her trembling lips.</p>
        <p>"Here you are, Larry."</p>
        <p>"It's no good to me. Won't you keep it as a memento of our friendship? You can wear it on your little finger. Our friendship needn't stop, need it?"</p>
        <p>"I shall always care for you, Larry."</p>
        <p>"Then keep it. I should like you to."</p>
        <p>She hesitated for an instant, then put it on the finger of her right hand.</p>
        <p>"It's too large."</p>
        <p>"You can have it altered. Let's go to the Ritz bar and have a drink."</p>
        <p>"All right."</p>
        <p>She was a trifle taken aback that it had all gone so easily. She had not cried. Nothing seemed to be changed except that now she wasn't going to marry Larry. She could hardly believe that everythmg was over and done with. She resented a little the fact that they hadn't had a terrific scene. They had talked it all over almost as coolly as though they had been discussing the taking of a house. She felt let down, but at the same time was conscious of a slight sense of satisfaction because they had behaved in such a civilized way. She would have given a lot to know exactly what Larry was feeling. But it was always difficult to know that; his smooth face, his dark eyes were a mask that she was aware even she, who had known him for so many years, could not penetrate. She had taken off her hat and laid it on the bed. Now, standing before the mirror, she put it on again.</p>
        <p>"Just as a matter of interest," she said, arranging her hair, "did you want to break our engagement?"</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"I thought it might be a relief to you." He made no reply. She turned round with a gay smile on her lips. "Now I'm ready."</p>
        <p>Larry locked the door behind him. When he handed the key to the man at the desk he enveloped them both in a look of conniving archness. It was impossible for Isabel not to guess what he thought they had been up to.</p>
        <p>"I don't believe that old fellow would bet much on my virginity," she said.</p>
        <p>They took a taxi to the Ritz and had a drink. They spoke of indifferent things, without apparent constraint, like two old friends who saw one another every day. Though Larry was naturally silent, Isabel was a talkative girl, with an ample fund of chit-chat, and she was determined that no silence should fall between them that might be hard to break. She wasn't going to let Larry think she felt any resentment towards him and her pride constrained her to act so that he should not suspect that she was hurt and unhappy. Presently she suggested that he should drive her home. When he dropped her at the door she said to him gaily:</p>
        <p>"Don't forget that you're lunching with us tomorrow."</p>
        <p>"You bet your life I won't."</p>
        <p>She gave him her cheek to kiss and passed through the porte cochere.</p>

        <p><i>(v)</i></p>
        <p>When Isabel entered the drawing-room she found that some people had dropped in to tea. There were two American women who lived in Paris, exquisitely gowned, with strings of pearls round their necks, diamond bracelets on their wrists and costly rings on their fingers. Though the hair of one was darkly hennaed and that of the other unnaturally golden they were strangely alike. They had the same heavily mascaraed eyelashes, the same brightly painted lips, the same rouged cheeks, the same slim figures, maintained at the cost of extreme mortification, the same clear, harp features, the same hungry restless eyes; and you could not but be conscious that their lives were a desperate struggle to maintain their fading charms. They talked with inanity in a loud, metallic voice without a moment's pause, as though afraid that if they were silent for an instant the machine would run down and the artificial construction which was all they were would fall to pieces. There was also a secretary from the American Embassy, suave, silent, for he could not get a word in, and very much the man of the world, and a small dark Rumanian prince, all bows and servility, with little darting black eyes and a clean-shaven swarthy face, who was for ever jumping up to hand a teacup, pass a plate of cakes, or light a cigarette, and who shamelessly dished out to those present the most flattering, the most gross compliments. He was paying for all the dinners he had received from the objects of his adulation and for all the dinners he hoped to receive.
        </p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley, seated at the tea table and dressed to please Elliott somewhat more grandly than she thought suitable to the occasion, performed her duties as hostess with her usual civil but rather indifferent composure. What she thought of her brother's guests I can only imagine. I never knew her more than slightly and she was a woman who kept herself to herself. She was not a stupid woman; in all the years she had lived in foreign capitals she had met innumerable people of all kinds and I think she summed them up shrewdly enough according to the standards of the small Virginian town where she was bom and bred. I think she got a certain amount of amusement from observing their antics and I don't believe she took their airs and graces any more seriously than she took the aches and pains of the characters in a novel which she knew from the beginning (otherwise she wouldn't have read it) would end happily. Paris, Rome, Peking had had no more effect on her Americanism than Elliott's devout Catholicism on her robust, but not inconvenient, Presbyterian faith.
        </p>
        <p>Isabel, with her youth, her strapping good looks and her vitality brought a breath of fresh air into that meretricious atmosphere. She swept in like a young earth goddess. The Rumanian prince leapt to his feet to draw forward a chair for her and with ample gesticulation did his shift. The two American ladies, with shrill amiabilities on their lips, looked her up and down, took in the details of her dress and perhaps in their hearts felt a pang of dismay at being confronted with her exuberant youth. The American diplomat smiled to himself as he saw how false and haggard she made them look. But Isabel thought they were grand; she liked their rich clothes and expensive pearls and felt a twinge of envy for their sophisticated poise. She wondered if she would ever achieve that supreme elegance. Of course the little Rumanian was quite ridiculous, but he was rather sweet and even if he didn't mean the charming things he said it was nice to listen to them. The conversation which her entrance had interrupted was resumed and they talked so brightly, with so much conviction that what they were saying was worth saying, that you almost thought they were talking sense. They talked of the parties they had been to and the parties they were going to. They gossiped about the latest scandal. They tore their friends to pieces. They bandied great names from one to the other. They seemed to know everybody. They were in on all the secrets. Almost in a breath they touched upon the latest play, the latest dressmaker, the latest portrait painter, and the latest mistress of the latest premier. One would have thought there was nothing they didn't know. Isabel listened with ravishment. It all seemed to her wonderfully civilized. This really was life. It gave her a thrilling sense of being in the midst of things. This was real. The setting was perfect. That spacious room with the Savonneric carpet on the floor, the lovely drawings on the richly-panelled walls, the petit-point chairs on which they sat, the priceless pieces of marquetry, commodes and occasional tables, every piece worthy to go into a museum; it must have cost a fortune, that room, but it was worth it. Its beauty, its discretion struck her as never before because she had still so vividly in her mind the shabby little hotel room, with its iron bed and that hard, comfortless chair in which he had sat, that room that Larry saw nothing wrong in. It was bare, cheerless and horrid. It made her shudder to remember it.
        </p>
        <p>The party broke up and Isabel was left with her mother and Elliott.</p>
        <p>"Charming women," said Elliott when he came back from seeing the two poor painted drabs to the door. "I knew them when they first settled in Paris. I never dreamt they'd turn out as well as they have. It's amazing, the adaptability of our women. You'd hardly know now they were Americans and Middle West into the bargain."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley, raising her eyebrows, without speaking gave him a look which he was too quick-witted not to understand.</p>
        <p>"No one could ever say that of you, my poor Louisa," he continued half acidly and half affectionately. "Though heaven knows, you've had every chance."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley pursed her lips.</p>
        <p>"I'm afraid I've been a sad disappointment to you, Elliott, but to tell you the truth I'm very satisfied with myself as I am."</p>
        <p>"Tous les goûts sont dans la nature," Elliott murmured.</p>
        <p>"I think I ought to tell you that I'm no longer engaged to Larry," said Isabel.</p>
        <p>"Tut," cried Elliott. "That'll put my luncheon table out for tomorrow. How on earth am I going to get another man at this short notice?"</p>
        <p>"Oh, he's coming to lunch all right."</p>
        <p>"After you've broken off your engagement? That sounds very unconventional."</p>
        <p>Isabel giggled. She kept her gaze on Elliott, for she knew her mother's eyes were fixed upon her and she didn't want to meet them.</p>
        <p>"We haven't quarreled. We talked it over this afternoon and came to the conclusion we'd made a mistake. He doesn't want to come back to America; he wants to stop on in Paris. He's talking of going to Greece."</p>
        <p>"What on earth for? There's no society in Athens. As a matter of fact I never thought so much of Greek art myself. Some of that Hellenistic stuff has a certain decadent charm that's rather attractive. But Phidias: no, no."</p>
        <p>"Look at me, Isabel," said Mrs. Bradley.</p>
        <p>Isabel turned and with a faint smile on her lips faced her mother. Mrs. Bradley gave her a scrutinizing stare, but all she said was, "H'm." The girl hadn't been crying, that she saw; she looked calm and composed.</p>
        <p>"I think you're well out of it, Isabel," said Elliott. "I was prepared to make the best of it, but I never thought it a good match. He wasn't really up to your mark, and the way he's been behaving in Paris is a pretty clear indication that he'll never amount to anything. With your looks and your connections you can aspire to something better than that. I think you've behaved in a very sensible manner."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley gave her daughter a glance that was not devoid of anxiety.</p>
        <p>"You haven't done this on my account, Isabel?"</p>
        <p> Isabel shook her head decidedly. "No, darling, I've done it entirely on my own."</p>

        <p><i>(vi)</i></p>
        <p>I had come back from the East and was spending some time in London just then. It was perhaps a fortnight after the events I have just related that Elliott called me up one morning. I was not surprised to hear his voice, for I knew that he was in the habit of coming to England to enjoy the fag end of the season. He told me that Mrs. Bradley and Isabel were with him and if I would drop in that evening at six for a drink they would be glad to see me. They were, of course, staying at Claridge's. I was at that time living not far from there, so I strolled down Park Lane and through the quiet, dignified streets of Mayfair till I came to the hotel. Elliott had his usual suite. It was panelled in brown wood like the wood of a cigar box and furnished with quiet sumptuousness. He was alone when I was ushered in. Mrs. Bradley and Isabel had gone shopping and he was expecting them at any minute. He told me that Isabel had broken her engagement to Larry.</p>
        <p>Elliott with his romantic and highly conventional sense of how people should comport themselves under given circumstances had been disconcerted by the young people's behaviour. Not only had Larry come to lunch the very day after the break, but he had acted as though his position were unchanged. He was as pleasant, attentive and soberly gay as usual. He treated Isabel with the same comradely affectionateness with which he had always treated her. He seemed neither harassed, upset nor woe-begone. Nor did Isabel appear dispirited. She looked as happy, she laughed as lightly, she jested as merrily as though she had not just taken a decisive and surely searing step in her life. Elliott could not make head or tail of it. From such scraps of their conversation as he caught he gathered that they had no intention of breaking any of the dates they had made. On the first opportunity he talked it over with his sister.</p>
        <p>"It's not decent," he said. "They can't run around together as if they were still engaged. Larry really should have more sense of propriety. Besides, it damages Isabel's chances. Young Fotheringham, that boy at the British Embassy, is obviously taken with her; he's got money and he's very well connected; if he knew the coast was clear I wouldn't be at all surprised if he made her an offer, I think you ought to talk to her about it."</p>
        <p>"My dear, Isabel's twenty and she has a technique for telling you to mind your own business without offensiveness which I've always found very difficult to cope with."</p>
        <p>"Then you've brought her up extremely badly, Louisa. And besides, it <i>is</i> your business."</p>
        <p>"That is a point on which you and she would certainly differ."</p>
        <p>"You're trying my patience, Louisa."</p>
        <p>"My poor Elliott, if you'd ever had a grown-up daughter you'd know that by comparison a bucking steer is easy to manage. And as to knowing what goes on inside her—well, it's much better to pretend you're the simple, innocent old fool she almost certainly takes you for."</p>
        <p>"But you have talked the matter over with her?"</p>
        <p>"I tried to. She laughed at me and told me there was really nothing to tell."</p>
        <p>"Is she cut up?"</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't know. All I do know is that she eats well and sleeps like a child."</p>
        <p>"Well, take my word for it, if you let them go on like this they'll go off one of these days and get married without saying a word to anybody."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bradley permitted herself to smile.</p>
        <p>"It must be a relief to you to think that at present we're living in a country where every facility is afforded to sexual irregularity and every obstacle put in the way of marriage."</p>
        <p>"And quite rightly. Marriage is a serious matter on which rest the security of the family and the stability of the state. But marriage can only maintain its authority if extraconjugal relations are not only tolerated but sanctioned. Prostitution, my poor Louisa——"</p>
        <p>"That'll do, Elliott,' interrupted Mrs. Bradley. "I'm not interested in your views on the social and moral values of promiscuous fornication."</p>
        <p>It was then he put forward a scheme that would interrupt Isabel's continued intercourse with Larry, which was so repugnant to his sense of what was fitting. The Paris season was drawing to a close and all the best people were arranging to go to watering places or to Deauville before repairing for the rest or the summer to their ancestral chateaus in Touraine, Anjou or Brittany, Ordinarily Elliott went to London at the end of June, but his family feeling was strong and his affection for his sister and Isabel sincere; he had been quite ready to sacrifice himself and remain in Paris, if they wished it, when no one who was anyone was there; but he found himself now in the agreeable situation of being able to do what was best for others and at the same time what was convenient to himself. He proposed to Mrs. Bradley that the three of them should go to London immediately, where the season was still in full swing and where new interests and new friends would distract Isabel's mind from her unfortunate entanglement. According to the papers the great specialist on Mrs. Bradley's disease was then in the British capital and the desirability of consulting him would reasonably account for their precipitate departure and override any disinclination to leave Paris that Isabel might have. Mrs. Bradley fell in with the plan. She was puzzled by Isabel. She could not make up her mind whether she was as carefree as she seemed or whether, hurt, angry or heartsick, she was putting on a bold front to conceal her wounded feelings. Mrs. Bradley could only agree with Elliott that it would do Isabel good to see new people and new places.
        </p>
        <p>Elliott got busy on the telephone and when Isabel, who had been spending the day at Versailles with Larry, came home, he was able to tell her that he had made an appointment for her mother to see the celebrated doctor three days from then, that he had engaged a suite at Claridge's and that they were starting on the next day but one. Mrs. Bradley watched her daughter while this intelligence was being somewhat smugly imparted to her by Elliott, but she did not turn a hair.</p>
        <p> "Oh, darling, I'm so glad you're going to see that doctor," she cried with her usual rather breathless impetuosity. "Of course, you mustn't miss the chance. And it'll be grand going to London. How long are we going to stay?"</p>
        <p>"It would be useless to come back to Paris," said Elliott. "There won't be a soul here in a week. I want you to stay with me at Claridge's for the rest of the season. There are always some good balls in July and of course there's Wimbledon. And then Goodwood and Cowes. I'm sure the Ellinghams will be glad to have us on their yacht for Cowes and the Bantocks always have a large party for Goodwood."</p>
        <p>Isabel appeared to be delighted and Mrs. Bradley was reassured. It looked as though she were not giving Larry a thought.</p>
        <p>Elliott had just finished telling me all this when mother and daughter came in. I had not seen them for more than eighteen months. Mrs. Bradley was a little thinner than before and more pasty-faced; she looked tired and none too well. But Isabel was blooming. With her high colour, the rich brown of her hair, her snining hazel eyes, her clear skin, she gave an impression of such youth, of so much enjoyment of the mere fact of being alive, that you felt half inclined to laugh with delight. She gave me the rather absurd notion of a pear, golden and luscious, perfectly ripe and simply asking to be eaten. She radiated warmth so that you thought that if you held out your hands you could feel its comfort. She looked taller than when I had last seen her, whether because she wore higher heels or because the clever dressmaker had cut her frock to conceal her youthful plumpness I don't know, and she held herself with the graceful ease of a girl who has played outdoor games since childhood. She was in short sexually a very attractive young woman. Had I been her mother I should have thought it high time she was married.
        </p>
        <p>Glad of the opportunity to repay some of the kindness I had received from Mrs. Bradley in Chicago, I asked them all three to come to a play with me one evening. I arranged to give a luncheon for them.</p>
        <p> "You'll be wise to get in at once, my dear fellow," said Elliott. "I've already let my friends know we're here and I presume that in a day or two we shall be fixed up for the rest of the season."</p>
        <p>I understood by this that Elliott meant that then they would have no time for the likes of me and I laughed. Elliott gave me a glance in which I discerned a certain hauteur.</p>
        <p>"But of course you'll generally find us here about six o'clock and we shall always be glad to see you," he said graciously, but with the evident intention of putting me, as an author, in my humble place.</p>
        <p>But the worm sometimes turns.</p>
        <p>"You must try to get in touch with the St. Olpherds," I said. "I hear they want to dispose of their Constable of Salisbury Cathedral."</p>
        <p>"I'm not buying any pictures just now."</p>
        <p>"I know, but I thought you might dispose of it for them."</p>
        <p>A steely gutter came into Elliott's eyes.</p>
        <p>"My dear fellow, the English are a great people, but they have never been able to paint and never will be able to paint. I am not interested in the English school."</p>

        <p><i>(vii)</i></p>
        <p>During the next four weeks I saw little of Elliott and his relations. He did them proud. He took them for a weekend to a grand house in Sussex and for another weekend to an even grander one in Wiltshire. He took them to the royal box at the opera as guests of a minor princess of the House of Windsor. He took them to lunch and dine with the great. Isabel went to several balls. He entertained at Claridge's a series of guests whose names made a fine show in the paper next day. He gave supper parties at Giro's and the Embassy. In fact he did all the right things and Isabel would have had to be much more sophisticated than she was not to have been a trifle dazzled by the splendour and elegance he provided for her delectation. Elliott could flatter himself that he was taking all this trouble from the purely unselfish motive of distracting Isabel's mind from an unfortunate love affair; but I had a notion he got besides a good deal of satisfaction out of letting his sister see with her own eyes how familiar he was with the illustrious and fashionable. He was an admirable host and he took a delight in displaying his virtuosity.
        </p>
        <p>I went to one or two of his parties myself and now and again I dropped in at Claridge's at six o'clock. I found Isabel surrounded by strapping young men in beautiful clothes who were in the Household Brigade or by elegant young men in less beautiful clothes from the Foreign Office. It was on one of these occasions that she drew me aside.</p>
        <p>"I want to ask you something," she said. "Do you remember that evening we went to a drugstore and had an ice-cream soda?"</p>
        <p>"Perfectly."</p>
        <p>"You were very nice and helpful then. Will you be nice and helpful again?"</p>
        <p>"I'll do my best."</p>
        <p>"I want to talk to you about something. Couldn't we lunch one day?"</p>
        <p>"Almost any day you like."</p>
        <p>"Somewhere quiet."</p>
        <p>"What d'you say to driving down to Hampton Court and lunching there? The gardens should be at their best just now and you could see Queen Elizabeth's bed."</p>
        <p>The notion suited her and we fixed a day. But when the day came the weather, which had been fine and warm, broke; the sky was grey and a drizzling rain was falling. I called up and asked her if she wouldn't prefer to lunch in town.</p>
        <p>"We shouldn't be able to sit in the gardens and the pictures will be so dark, we shan't see a thing."</p>
        <p>"I’ve sat in lots of gardens and I'm fed to the teeth with old masters. Let's go anyway."</p>
        <p>"All right."</p>
        <p>I fetched her and we drove down. I knew a small hotel where one ate tolerably and we went straight there. On the way Isabel talked with her usual vivacity of the parties she had been to and the people she had met. She had been enjoying herself, but her comments on the various acquaintances she had made suggested to me that she had shrewdness and a quick eye for the absurd. The bad weather kept visitors away and we were the only occupants of the dining-room. The hotel specialized in homely English fare and we had a cut off of a leg of excellent lamb with green peas and new potatoes and a deep-dish apple pie with Devonshire cream to follow. With a tankard of pale ale it made an excellent lunch, When we had finished I suggested that we should go into the empty coffee-room where there were armchairs in which we could sit in comfort. It was chilly in there, but the fire was laid, so I put a match to it. The flames made the dingy room more companionable.</p>
        <p>"That's that," I said. "Now tell me what you want to talk to me about."</p>
        <p>"It's the same as last time," she chuckled. "Larry."</p>
        <p>"So I guessed."</p>
        <p>"You know that we've broken off our engagement."</p>
        <p>"Elliott told me."</p>
        <p>"Mamma's relieved and he's delighted."</p>
        <p>She hesitated for a moment and then embarked upon the account of her talk with Larry of which I have done my best faithfully to inform the reader. It may surprise the reader that she should have chosen to tell so much to someone whom she knew so little. I don't suppose I had seen her a dozen times and, except for that one occasion at the drugstore, never alone. It did not surprise me. For one thing, as any writer will tell you, people do tell a writer things that they don't tell others. I don't know why, unless it is that having read one or two of his books they feel on peculiarly intimate terms with him; or it may be that they dramatize themselves and, seeing themselves as it were as characters in a novel, are ready to be as open with him as they imagine the characters of his invention are. And I think that Isabel felt that I liked Larry and her, and that their youth touched me, and that I was sympathetic to their distresses. She could not expect to find a friendly listener in Elliott who was disinclined to trouble himself with a young man who had spurned the best chance a young man ever had of getting into society. Nor could her mother help her. Mrs. Bradley had high principles and common sense. Her common sense assured her that if you wanted to get on in this world you must accept its conventions, and not to do what everybody else did clearly pointed to instability. Her high principles led her to believe that a man's duty was to go to work in a business where by energy and initiative he had a chance of earning enough money to keep his wife and family in accordance with the standards of his station, give his sons such an education as would enable them on reaching man's estate to make an honest living, and on his death leave his widow adequately provided for.
        </p>
        <p>Isabel had a good memory and the various turns of the long discussion had engraved themselves upon it. I listened in silence till she had finished. She only interrupted herself once to ask me a question.</p>
        <p>"Who was Ruysdael?"</p>
        <p>"Ruysdael? He was a Dutch landscape painter. Why?"</p>
        <p>She told me that Larry had mentioned him. He had said that Ruysdael at least had found an answer to the questions he was asking, and she repeated to me his flippant reply when she had enquired who he was.</p>
        <p>"What d'you suppose he meant?"</p>
        <p>I had an inspiration.</p>
        <p>"Are you sure he didn't say Ruysbroek?"</p>
        <p>"He might have. Who was he?"</p>
        <p>"He was a Flemish mystic who lived in the fourteenth century."</p>
        <p>"Oh," she said with disappointment.</p>
        <p>It meant nothing to her. But it meant something to me. That was the first indication I had of the turn Larry's reflection was taking, and while she went on with her story, though still listening attentively, part of my mind busied itself with the possibilities that reference of his had suggested. I did not want to make too much of it, for it might be that he had only mentioned the name of the Ecstatic Teacher to make an argumentative point; it might also have a significance that had escaped Isabel. When he answered her question by saying Ruysbroek was just a guy he hadn't known in college he evidently meant to throw her off the scent.</p>
        <p>"What do you make of it all?" she asked when she had come to an end.</p>
        <p>I paused before replying.</p>
        <p>"D'you remember his saying that he was just going to loaf? If what he tells you is true his loafing seems to involve some very strenuous work."</p>
        <p>"I'm sure it's true. But don't you see that if he'd worked as hard at any productive form of work he'd be earning a decent income?"</p>
        <p>"There are people who are strangely constituted. There are criminals who'll work like beavers to contrive schemes that land them in prison and they no sooner get out than they start all over again and again land in prison. If they put as much industry, as much cleverness, resource and patience into honest practices they could make a handsome living and occupy important positions. But they're just made that way. They like crime."</p>
        <p>"Poor Larry," she giggled. "You're not going to suggest that he's learning Greek to cook up a bank robbery?"</p>
        <p>I laughed too.</p>
        <p>"No, I'm not. What I'm trying to tell you is that there are men who are possessed by an urge so strong to do some particular thing that they can't help themselves, they've got to do it. They're prepared to sacrifice everything to satisfy their yearning."</p>
        <p>"Even the people who love them?"</p>
        <p>"Oh, yes."</p>
        <p>"Is that anything more than plain selfishness?"</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't know," I smiled.</p>
        <p>"What can be the possible use of Larry’s learning dead languages?"</p>
        <p>"Some people have a disinterested desire for knowledge. It's not an ignoble desire."</p>
        <p>"What's the good of knowledge if you're not going to do anything with it?"</p>
        <p>"Perhaps he is. Perhaps it will be sufficient satisfaction merely to know, as it's a sufficient satisfaction to an artist to produce a work of art. And perhaps it's only a step towards something further."</p>
        <p>"If he wanted knowledge why couldn't he go to college when he came back from the war? It's what Dr. Nelson and Mamma wanted him to do."</p>
        <p>"I talked to him about that in Chicago. A degree would be of no use to him. I have an inkling that he had a definite idea of what he wanted and felt he couldn't get it at a university. You know, in learning there's the lone wolf as well as the wolf who runs in the pack. I think Larry is one of those persons who can go no other way than their own."</p>
        <p>"I remember once asking him if he wanted to write. He laughed and said he had nothing to write about."</p>
        <p>"That's the most inconclusive reason for not writing that I've ever heard," I smiled.</p>
        <p>Isabel made a gesture of impatience. She was in no mood even for the mildest jest.</p>
        <p>"What I can't make out is why he should have turned out like this. Before the war he was just like everybody else. You wouldn't think it, but he plays a very good game of tennis and he's quite a decent golfer. He used to do all the things the rest of us did. He was a perfectly normal boy and there was no reason to suppose he wouldn't become a perfectly normal man. After all you're a novelist, you ought to be able to explain it."</p>
        <p>"Who am I to explain the infinite complexities of human nature?"</p>
        <p>"That's why I wanted to talk to you today," she added, taking no notice of what I said.</p>
        <p>"Are you unhappy?"</p>
        <p>"No, not exactly unhappy. When Larry isn't there I'm all right; it's when I'm with him that I feel so weak. Now it's just a sort of ache, like the stiffness you get after a long ride when you haven't been on a horse for months; it's not pain, it's not at all unbearable, but you're conscious of it. I shall get over it all right. I hate the idea of Larry making such a mess of his life."</p>
        <p>"Perhaps he won't. It's a long, arduous road he's starting to travel, but it may be that at the end of it he'll find what he's seeking."</p>
        <p>"What's that?"</p>
        <p>"Hasn't it occurred to you? It seems to me that in what he said to you he indicated it pretty plainly. God."</p>
        <p>"God!" she cried. But it was an exclamation of incredulous surprise. Our use of the same word, but in such a different sense, had a comic effect, so that we were obliged to laugh. But Isabel immediately grew serious again and I felt in her whole attitude something like fear. "What on earth makes you think that?"</p>
        <p>"I'm only guessing. But you asked me to tell you what I thought as a novelist. Unfortunately you don't know what experience he had in the war that so profoundly moved him. I think it was some sudden shock for which he was unprepared. I suggest to you that whatever it was that happened to Larry filled him with a sense of the transiency of life, and an anguish to be sure that there was a compensation for the sin and sorrow of the world."</p>
        <p>I could see that Isabel didn't like the turn I had given the conversation. It made her feel shy and awkward.</p>
        <p>"Isn't all that awfully morbid? One has to take the world as it comes. If we're here, it's surely to make the most of life."</p>
        <p>"You're probably right."</p>
        <p>"I don't pretend to be anything but a perfectly normal, ordinary girl. I want to have fun."</p>
        <p>"It looks as though there were complete incompatibility of temper between you. It's much better that you should have found it out before marriage."</p>
        <p>"I want to marry and have children and live——"</p>
        <p>"In that state of life in which a merciful Providence has been pleased to place you," I interrupted, smiling.</p>
        <p>"Well, there's no harm in that, is there? It's a very pleasant state and I'm quite satisfied with it."</p>
        <p>"You're like two friends who want to take their holiday together, but one of them wants to climb Greenland's icy mountains while the other wants to fish off India's coral strand. Obviously it's not going to work."</p>
        <p>"Anyway, I might get a sealskin coat off Greenland's icy mountains, and I think it's very doubtful if there are any fish off India's coral strand."</p>
        <p>"That remains to be seen."</p>
        <p>"Why d'you say that?" she asked, frowning a little. "All the time you seem to be making some sort of mental reservation. Of course I know that I'm not playing the star part in this. Larry's got that. He's the idealist, he's the dreamer of a beautiful dream, and even if the dream doesn't come true, it's rather thrilling to have dreamt it. I'm cast for the hard, mercenary, practical part. Common sense is never very sympathetic, is it? But what you forget is that it's I who'd have to pay. Larry would sweep along, trailing clouds of glory, and all there'd be left for me would be to tag along and make both ends meet. I want to live."</p>
        <p>"I don't forget that at all. Years ago, when I was young, I knew a man who was a doctor, and not a bad one either, but he didn't practise. He spent years burrowing away in the library of the British Museum and at long intervals produced a huge pseudo-scientific, pseudo-philosophical book that nobody read and that he had to publish at his own expense. He wrote four or five of them before he died and they were absolutely worthless. He had a son who wanted to go into the army, but there was no money to send him to Sandhurst, so he had to enlist. He was killed in the war. He had a daughter too. She was very pretty and I was rather taken with her. She went on the stage, but she had no talent and she traipsed around the provinces playing small parts in second-rate companies at a miserable salary. His wife, after years of dreary, sordid drudgery broke down in health and the girl had to come home and nurse her and take on the drudgery her mother no longer had the strength for. Wasted, thwarted lives and all to no purpose. It's a toss-up when you decide to leave the beaten track. Many are called but few are chosen."
        </p>
        <p>"Mother and Uncle Elliott approve of what I've done. Do you approve too?"</p>
        <p>"My dear, what can that matter to you? I'm almost a stranger to you."</p>
        <p>"I look upon you as a disinterested observer," she said, with a pleasant smile. "I should like to have your approval. You do think I've done right, don't you?"</p>
        <p>"I think you've done right for you," I said, fairly confident that she would not catch the slight distinction I made in my reply.</p>
        <p>"Then why have I a bad conscience?"</p>
        <p>"Have you?"</p>
        <p>With a smile still on her lips, but a slightly rueful smile now, she nodded.</p>
        <p>"I know it's only horse sense. I know that every reasonable person would agree that I've done the only possible thing. I know that from every practical standpoint, from the standpoint of worldly wisdom, from the standpoint of common decency, from the standpoint of what's right and wrong, I've done what I ought to do. And yet at the bottom of my heart I've got an uneasy feeling that if I were better, if I were more disinterested, more unselfish, nobler, I'd marry Larry and lead his life. If I only loved him enough I'd think the world well lost."</p>
        <p>"You might put it the other way about. If he loved you enough he wouldn't have hesitated to do what you want."</p>
        <p>"I've said that to myself too. But it doesn't help. I suppose it's more in woman's nature to sacrifice herself than in a man's." She chuckled. "Ruth and the alien corn and all that sort of thing."</p>
        <p>"Why don't you risk it?"</p>
        <p>We had been talking quite lightly, almost as if we were having a casual conversation about people we both knew but in whose affairs we were not intimately concerned, and even when she narrated to me her talk with Larry, Isabel had spoken with a sort of breezy gaiety, enlivening it with humour, as if she did not want me to take what she said too seriously.</p>
        <p>But now she went pale.</p>
        <p>"I'm afraid."</p>
        <p>For a while we were silent. A chill went down my spine as it strangely does when I am confronted with deep and genuine human emotion. I find it terrible and rather awe-inspiring.</p>
        <p>"Do you love him very much?" I asked at last.</p>
        <p>"I don't know. I'm impatient with him. I'm exasperated with him. I keep longing for him."</p>
        <p>Silence again fell upon us. I didn't know what to say. The coffee-room in which we sat was small, and heavy lace curtains over the window shut out the light. On the walls, covered with yellow marbled paper, were old sporting prints. With its mahogany furniture, its shabby leather chairs and its musty smell it was strangely reminiscent of a coffee-room in a Dickens novel. I poked the fire and put more coal on it. Isabel suddenly began to speak.</p>
        <p>"You see, I thought when it came to a showdown he'd knuckle under. I knew he was weak."</p>
        <p>"Weak?" I cried. "What made you think that? A man who for a year withstood the disapproval of all his friends and associates because he was determined to go his own way."</p>
        <p>"I could always do anything I wanted with him. I could turn him round my little finger. He was never a leader in the things we did. He just tagged along with the crowd."</p>
        <p>I had lit a cigarette and watched the smoke ring I had made. It grew larger and larger and then faded away into the air. "Mamma and Elliott thought it very wrong of me to go about with him afterwards as though nothing had happened, but I didn't take it very seriously. I kept on thinking up to the end that he'd yield. I couldn't believe that when he'd got it into his thick head that I meant what I said he wouldn't give in." She hesitated and gave me a smile of roguish, playful malice. "Will you be awfully shocked if I tell you something?"</p>
        <p>"I think it very unlikely."</p>
        <p>"When we decided to come to London, I called Larry and asked him if we couldn't spend my last evening in Paris together. When I told them, Uncle Elliott said it was most improper and Mamma said she thought it unnecessary. When Mamma says something is unnecessary it means she thoroughly disapproves. Uncle Elliott asked me what the idea was and I said we were going to dine somewhere and then make a tour of the night clubs. He told Mamma she ought to forbid me to go. Mamma said, 'Will you pay any attention if I forbid you to go?' 'No, darling,' I said, 'none.' Then she said, 'That is what I imagined. In that case there doesn't seem to be much point in my forbidding it.' "</p>
        <p>"Your mother appears to be a woman of enormous sense."</p>
        <p>"I don't believe she misses much. When Larry called for me I went into her room to say good night to her. I'd made up a bit; you know, you have to in Paris or else you look so naked, and when she saw the dress I had on, I had an uneasy suspicion from the way she took me in from top to toe that she had a pretty shrewd idea what I was after. But she didn't say anything. She just kissed me and said she hoped I'd have a good time."</p>
        <p>"What were you after?"</p>
        <p>Isabel looked at me doubtfully, as though she couldn't quite decide how frank she was prepared to be.</p>
        <p>"I didn't think I was looking too bad and it was my last chance. Larry had reserved a table at Maxim's. We had lovely things to eat, all the things I particularly liked, and we had champagne. We talked our heads off, at least I did, and I made Larry laugh. One of the things I've liked about him is that I can always amuse him. We danced. When we'd had enough of that we went on to the Chateau de Madrid. We found some people we knew and joined them and we had more champagne. Then we all went to the Acacia. Larry dances quite well, and we fit. The heat and the music and the wine—I was getting a bit light-headed. I felt absolutely reckless. I danced with my face against Larry's and I knew he wanted me. God knows I wanted him. I had an idea. I suppose it had been at the back of my mind all the time. I thought I'd get him to come home with me and once I'd got him there, well, it was almost inevitable that the inevitable should happen."</p>
        <p>"Upon my word you couldn't put it more delicately."</p>
        <p>"My room was quite a way from Uncle Elliott's and Mamma's, so I knew there was no risk. When we were back in America I thought I'd write and say I was going to have a baby. He'd be obliged to come back and marry me, and when I'd got him home I didn't believe it would be hard to keep him there, especially with Mamma ill. 'What a fool I am not to have thought of that before,' I said to myself. 'Of course that'll settle everything.' When the music stopped I just stayed there in his arms. Then I said it was getting late and we had to take the train at noon, so we'd better go. We got into a taxi. I nestled close to him and he put his arms around me and kissed me. He kissed me, he kissed me—oh, it was heaven. It hardly seemed a moment before the taxi stopped at the door. Larry paid it.</p>
        <p>" 'I shall walk home,' he said.</p>
        <p>"The taxi rattled off and I put my arms round his neck.</p>
        <p>" 'Won't you come up and have one last drink?' I said.</p>
        <p>" 'Yes, if you like,' he said,</p>
        <p>"He'd rung the bell and the door swung open. He switched on the light as we stepped in, I looked into his eyes. They were so trusting, so honest, so—so guileless; he so obviously hadn't the smallest idea that I was laying a trap for him; I felt I couldn't play him such a dirty trick. It was like taking candy off a child. D'you know what I did? I said, 'Oh well, perhaps you'd better not. Mamma's not very well tonight and if she's fallen asleep I don't want to wake her up. Good night.' I put my face up for him to kiss and pushed him out of the door. That was the end of that."</p>
        <p>"Are you sorry?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"I'm neither pleased nor sorry. I just couldn't help myself. It wasn't me that did what I did. It was just an impulse that took possession of me and acted for me." She grinned. "I suppose you'd call it my better nature."</p>
        <p>"I suppose you would."</p>
        <p>"Then my better nature must take the consequences. I trust in the future it'll be more careful."</p>
        <p>That was in effect the end of our talk. It may be that it was some consolation to Isabel to have been able to speak to someone with entire freedom, but that was all the good I had been able to do her. Feeling I had been inadequate, I tried to say at least some small thing that would give her comfort.</p>
        <p>"You know, when one's in love," I said, "and things go all wrong, one's terribly unhappy and one thinks one won't ever get over it. But you'll be astounded to learn what the sea will do."</p>
        <p>"What do you mean?" she smiled.</p>
        <p>"Well, love isn't a good sailor and it languishes on a sea voyage. You'll be surprised when you have the Atlantic between you and Larry to find how slight the pang is that before you sailed seemed intolerable."</p>
        <p>"Do you speak from experience?"</p>
        <p>"From the experience of a stormy past. When I suffered from the pangs of unrequited love I immediately got on an ocean liner."</p>
        <p>The rain showed no sign of letting up, so we decided that Isabel could survive without seeing the noble pile of Hampton Court or even Queen Elizabeth's bed, and drove back to London, I saw her two or three times after that, but only when other people were present, and then, having had enough of London for a while, I set off for the Tyrol.</p>

    <p>You are going to get validation in your life from somewhere. I would urge you to seriously look at where you are currently getting that validation. Your social circle? Some quality about you that you take pride in? Your work and accomplishments? Your significant other? You know, growing up I was told to think about my future. And I truly know that I now have. For these mere decades of dust bound to gravity and earth are absolutely nothing compared to the greatness that awaits for those of faith in Jesus in the life to come. That's my future - Jesus Christ, by His grace alone. Think about your future - do not all paths lead to death? What's your plan - when death is no longer restricted from sweeping you and all that you did away forever?</p>
    <li>*</li>
    <p>So think about your future. But in addition to thinking 10, 20, 30 years in the future, please, for the sake of your soul, think 100, 200, 300 years in the future and ask yourself, "To what end do I live this way?" I tell you dearly, I have thought at great length and depth of matters such as these, and our hope is only in the love shown by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the way, the truth, and the life. All else is distraction that subtly and sinisterly kills. But in and through Christ, we have clarity for our minds, the truest joy imaginable in our hearts, and, finally, the ability to love and live how we were meant to before, tragically, we thought it fit to make ourselves the god of our life. Truly I tell you that endeavor only ends with death. But take heart, for true love and life is out there and He wants you to open your heart to getting to know Him!</p>
    <li>*</li>
    <p>We all have faith in something. What are the fruits of your faith?</p>
    </p>
    <p><u>Galatians 5:22-23</u></p>
    <p class="phosphate">"But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law."</p>
    <p><u>1 John 4:16</u></p>
    <p class="phosphate">"And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them."</p>
    <p><u>1 Corinthians 13:4-8</u></p>
    <p class="phosphate">"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away."</p>
    <p><u>Romans 5:1</u></p>
    <p class="phosphate">"Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
    <p><u>Proverbs 10:24-25</u></p>
    <p class="phosphate">"What the wicked dread will overtake them; what the righteous desire will be granted. When the storm has swept by, the wicked are gone, but the righteous stand firm forever."</p>
    <p>And perhaps the most valuable realization out there -</p>
    <p>God saw that wisdom needed to be and Job 28:28 is it.</p>
    <p><u>Job 28:28</u></p>
    <p class="phosphate">"And unto man he said, behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding."</p>
    <p>That's it. That's wisdom.</p>
    <p>Oh to travel back in time, and do it all differently - with real wisdom at our heels.</p>
    <p>You know what I'd do? I'd go back in time, livid at myself, lucid in wisdom, bust down the front door, sprint over to my mangled body, shake myself senseless, and yell as loudly as possible, at the top of my lungs, so everyone could hear:</p>
    <h1><b><u><i>Love is so much better than this!</i></u></b></h1>

    <p><b>Author's note:</b></p>
    <p><b>And so, though it is my great wish to edit the following of parts five through seven until I am satisfied with their fluidity, I'm humbled by a dove who came from heaven, and this bird has ordered some of his servants to begin closing up shop here on earth, for truly, He is at the very gates. Therefore, I find it prudent to get this message out, at the expense of the lack of readiness of the remainder of these parts. Perhaps I will have time at a later date to revise accordingly. God bless you!!!</b></p>
    <p>And these are my thoughts on the struggle bred in this world of transforming despair into joy, a feat only accomplished courtesy of His upholding:
      <ul>
        <li>I want to cry. I want to weep for joy and ball for despair. I want peace, happiness, and love. I want the highest quality. I want to understand truth. I want to both enjoy and figure out life for its beauty and ripeness. I want to create and experience gorgeous, diverse, fascinating stories. But based on past experience, and the present silence, I need to shut up.</li>
        <br />
        <li>One of my dreams is to relax in my existence, rest my gaze upon the colorful sunset, and roll around the candy of an aphoristic teaching with my tongue, sucking the thought from a billion different flavors, and digesting love.</li>
        <br />
        <li>I was and am a black sheep. I will strive to welcome and love all sheep no matter what.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Step back, smile, and give the camera a wink. You're in on the façade of the adult world. Enjoy the charade, as it is the fakest thing you will encounter.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Woe! And look and feel and behold as I tell unto you this story set to unfold. A long ways away man said to God, I'm king! And behold man looked down at his finger and took off his ring! And so man was wed to himself and therefore despair! Because good wasn't in him because God wasn't there! No magnitude of broken souls will repay that decision to disobey, thank Adam for that and to Jesus I urge you pray "ho! Good lord and mighty master of me! Forgive my sins and my countless utterings of blasphemy! Take me back home under your roof where I belong! And until that fateful day, on this journey I'll sing your song: "in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. He brought you and me into existence, and loves us past death and from birth!"</li>
        <br />
        <li>What an amazing thing that though the writer within me begs to see God as first an Artist, I know because of His Word that He is first the Father.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Most important thing you can say to someone? "I'm with you". If you’re reading this, may you believe it for yourself, <i>I’m with you.</i></li>
        <br />
        <li>Everything is a reflection of God's truth. Man is made in the image of God, and all that happens in man's world is metaphors that adhere to God's character. Everything is set in motion by God who cares about individual souls and hearts and minds and is choosing to portray everything in its way so that every individual lives what is necessary for the glorification of the Son and the opportunity of ultimate freedom and love and relationship with the individual (with the sons) (Spirit and father and son). Everything is relationship. What are the relationships of earth that you know of as a man and what are their heavenly correlation/metaphor?</li>
        <br />
        <li>So, against all odds, and despite the pride of man, everything that the wicked do, God uses for the benefit of the righteous.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Though I have wounded myself yet again, ere tomorrow I implore the night to ready itself as it may, for the sun is rising with a sharpness that will pierce the darkness forever, and behold, in its foolishness it forgets it is bleeding out, even this very moment, from the rays of the truest righteousness.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Oh how unendingly fond I am of never growing up - I'll save them all in the rye if I can!</li>
        <br />
        <li>I am very careful about growing up. Because once you do, there's no going back. Not really. So I must tread lightly, and be sure I am taking all of the good with me into the next part of life and dropping all the bad for good.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Born with taste buds, I, like you, found the sweetness of candy a delight. But then I stepped back, my tongue retracted back into my heart, and I knew that an eternity of such flavor would be a mistake of existence. I was reminded that there is no such thing, and inferred the inevitable - that digesting the capacity to see beyond was all the nutrition I could ever want, much less need. The result is that I'm drowning - not in fear or despair or any of those lies - but in overwhelming joy. I've found it. What everyone's looking for. It is greater than I can describe. It is by my side. It is within me and around me. And it is within reach, much more so than you would think. It changes the color of everything to its true and vibrant hue. And I want you to see it too.</li>
        <br />
        <li>When you have just peaked a mountain, and you can feel the success of the strain in your muscles, and you are among fellow brothers and sisters in this familial hike up a hill. When you are high up on this hill, and the air is crisp and the night is pure, and your eyes gradually curve upward, even higher than the horizon that is enmeshed by jagged rolling mountains, and your gaze perfectly creeps ever upward until all of your vision is consumed by only the night sky. In that moment, when industry and commerce are far-fetched nothings, and the only thing in your ears is the echo of the crunch that your foot makes in the snow on the way up, when your neck is stretched to the heavens, and you begin to witness the exasperating light emanating from the earth's ceiling - galaxies, suns, and even some homely planets - a myriad of beauty and speckled perfection...in this exact moment, if you find sound reason to be cynical, if you find death better than life, if you find sadness better than joy...then that is when I'll concede that you're actually a cynic. Otherwise, you have just been searching to complain.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>How can one describe that indescribable love, that brotherhood, that deep sense of simultaneous understanding, appreciation, admiration, adoration, and connection that is bound by self-sacrifice and upheld by faith. How can one describe that which can only be felt - that which has the power to illuminate even the dungeons of your heart with energetic bliss.</li>
        <br />
        <li>I would rather listen to one soul share its story than share my own to a thousand.</li>
        <br />
        <li>A whole lot in me said I should never jump from a plane but my mind liked to forget that, by now, I had a state of the art parachute, and, the most encouraging thing of all - I knew the pilot and he told me that the whole plane ride is meant for skydiving, not sitting safely in the confines of the plane, gawking at the world outside the window.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Life is like a plane and all the people on it are all geared up to sky dive. There's a window in your life where you can sky dive and soar through life and people are going to urge you to jump with them. Some people jump and life is a wild ride. Some people are full of fear and keep their gear on but stay on the plane and the plane safely lands in the end. Still fun, but not quite skydiving.</li>
        <br />
        <li>I can think of nothing more joyful than being young and taking a step toward fulfilling your soul.</li>
        <br />
        <li>This is the good news. You are created in God's image. You are cordially and wonderfully invited to have the privilege of representing God to the world for you are made in His image. The holy creator of all that you've ever known likewise created you and wants to be with you. Forever. His love for you is perfect. But you turned away from him and ran as far away from His kingdom as you could. You worshipped so many other things. You accumulated so many sins over the years. And the penalty of sin is death. But God loves you so much that he's not going to have you pay it. God's love is perfect. And He wants you in such an amazing way that He sent His very own son, Jesus Christ, to die so that you may live. God sacrificed his own son for you. That is how much he loves you. The good news is this: You are made and loved by God to a degree that you literally cannot imagine. This is the good news: Jesus Christ, God's son, died for your sins so that you may live forever in glory and wonder and joy and love with God, just like God wanted since day one. Wow! Now that is something to leap with joy for!
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Perhaps the right word is value. We all seek to be of value. And if we do not get that from something, our lives begin to fall apart. With Christ Jesus, the soul knows its value. That is what I want other people to know - the true extent to which they are loved by God. How much He loves us is the good news.</li>
        <br />
        <li>We will all justify what we want to do so that we feel right in doing what we want to do so that we may experience what we want to experience. So the question is…what do you want to do? Why do you want to do it? And who do you want to be? Do you want money, success, fame, sex, power, comfort, social victory, physical victory, or do you want MORE DAMNIT YOU CAN HAVE SO MUCH MORE BUT YOU HAVE TO WANT TO HAVE IT AND TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE CONTENT TO WANT WHAT IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM AND WHAT IS FLEETING INSTEAD OF QUESTIONING THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS AND AIMING FOR GREATER AND GREATER WONDERS AS THEY WERE MEANT TO. But, woe and behold, for we all choose who we become, and our God is a perfect one who grants us full responsibility for ourselves.</li>
        <br />
        <li>When you take your children to a playground you don't say the reason why you're here is to climb this particular ladder. You let them be free to enjoy what they wish. So it is with this world.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Nobody knows what they are doing. Infinite illusions surround us and bombard us with their presence. And we believe some and reject others. And we think some are better than others. And we fail to see how, on some level, we are only creatures, with screwed up psychologies and personalities, unable to know truth, and see truth because of our human limitations - hopelessly blabbering about things that simply don't matter in the grand sense - blindly seeking nothing but attention and self-satisfaction - aimlessly tethered to routine - at the whims of rationalized philosophies - searching for a place to belong that may or may not exist - provoked by endless patterns...life undeserving of life - ... Which is why written word is so fascinating and reviving to take part in - any order of letters instantly attains perfection in one's own imagination - something truer than what is referred to as the world around us is surprisingly internal, dwelling within the confines of your own mind. Hence, any object of thought's degree of truth is only as true as one's belief in that object of thought (common fallacies include presuppositions, generalizations, stereotyping, and/or anything that has the possibility of leading to some form of misjudgment). Regardless of whatever philosophy is believed and acted on, there's something more to this world than what is conventional.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>There's nothing to win here, on board a stranded lifeboat.</li>
        <br />
        <li>It does not make sense to be jealous over what you directly encounter, for if you realized the immensity of experience present that you never encounter, then you would immediately understand the futility behind such a mindset with your natural limitations.</li>
        <br />
        <li>“Give me joy! Give me laughter! Numb me to the despair and hopelessness and difficulties around me. Allow me to wallow in simplicity. Cheap, effortless entertainment is my feast and I am happy with that. Let me see through the bewildering absurdity of all things and shield myself with laughter, assuring myself with the relief that because I do not directly see evil and convince myself that my questionable deeds are not evil, I am a good person, with good intentions and a good heart.” - the world</li>
          <br />
        <li>IF I'M BEING AS HONEST AS POSSIBLE, I FOUND IT I FOUND IT I FOUND THE HIDDEN TREASURE THAT IS ALL OUR SOUL TOILS FOR</li>

      <p>And these thoughts touch on how, through Jesus Christ, we have brilliance made through our tragedies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Though emptiness will scratch and claw at love, trying in vain to burst its fullness, let it be known that nothing in all of creation can escape the connection that love cultivates. You have been loved!</li>
          <br />
          <li>Feel the beauty ~~~ how can I share this with the world?</li>
          <br />
          <li>I want to look a brother or a sister in the eye and hold out my hand with agape love, breaking the shackles of their insecurity and raising them up, to love, just like God did to me, and just like God is doing right now.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Look into the eyes of your fellow brothers and sisters with love, for you all desire the same beautiful thing - the love and respect that God lovingly provides.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The gospel = the sheer love that is within our God for us, shown by the life and sacrifice and resurrection in Christ Jesus</li>
          <br />
          <li>Not only does true fear of God cultivate love, but knowing His greatness and majesty and depth reminds us that every evil thing against us, especially as followers and seekers of Him, is nothing. He is so unbelievably more mighty than it all.</li>
          <br />
          <li>How you treat others and how you treat the world is a direct correlation to how you treat yourself.</li>
          <br />
          <li>You don't become a Christian to get anything but Jesus Christ, Himself. All else is vanity. But few recognize the everlasting fulfillment in Him.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Initiative, persistence, and love for the process - indeed all processes of life are under the highest process - God unfolding himself to people and the world as He sees fit. Love the good times and good state of mind, for its own sake is a gift, but also do your best to love the bad times and the bad states of mind for the Lord has many blessings in disguise so as to teach and form and instruct and love His children in many spectacular ways.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Let us face ourselves in honesty. One of the main reasons you are reluctant to step back from faith in this world and put your faith in an everlasting one is because it is all you know. And also, because you don't want to wrestle with the reality that a lot of what you like to do, is wrong. Even the person who loves to do good things and loves to help others easily falls into the trap of doing so for, at its root, self-aggrandizing purposes.</li>
          <br />
          <li>"Only the unloved hate."</li>
          <br />
          <li>First you must understand what it means that you are something created by something that loves you with over a million tons of force. And try to understand the glory that it is to be a human being!</li>
          <br />
          <li>What I'm trying to tell you, really, is that now, I am not even afraid of death, because I know my Lord conquered death for both me and you. I do not want to die. But death holds no fear over me, for I know to my core that Christ conquered death. I am only fearful of the depth of goodness that I perceive to be in our Father in Heaven, the grace provided by His Son, Jesus Christ, and the love that the Holy Spirit cultivates in those that accept Him.</li>
          <br />
          <li>I perceived from above that all variables of life are present and in their proper places in order to first, glorify the Son, and second, transform the hearts of sinners from the vanity of themselves to the fullness only found in God.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Tragically, those with attention learn to say not what is right but what their audience agrees with.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The world will try to sedate you, to drug you, to fill you with lies like "I am not worthy of the love of God" or "Be complacent with who you are right now" or "Waste time doing what is ultimately nothing over here". The brilliant part is that God gives us the message and the right to refuse to listen to that and to turn our attention toward Him and His work.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The setting and experience of one's life itself does not matter, for in the love of God, everything is fulfilling no matter the circumstances, no matter the implications. As time progresses under the umbrella of Jesus Christ, Truth inevitably reveals itself, and the glory of Him can be seen in all things.</li>
          <br />
          <li>***If only the totality of his incomparable love could be realized every single waking moment. If only the fullness of his undeniable beauty could be witnessed with all good. And the most astounding fact of all existence, it can be realized so and it will be realized greatly.</li>
          <br />
          <li>What Jesus offers is what we need. What he has done, is doing, and will do, is for our best interests and in order to fulfill all that our heart desires.</li>
          <br />
          <li>How do we not know that that understanding, that faith, it’s there in all of us. It’s just either unrealized or communicated poorly.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Jesus gets crucified for blasphemy, because "he, a mere man, claimed to be God". The absolutely mind-blowing aspect of this is that the King of the universe is getting crucified/dying for the sins of everyone for claiming to be God when that is what everyone he is dying for claims in their sinful hearts (that they are God). It is beyond perfect of an act.</li>
          <br />
          <li>If you are breathing, then forgiveness is in the air.</li>
          <br />
          <li>When every waking instant is as magical as Christmas morning through a child's eyes, where people are seen genuinely, segregated from unrighteous judgment, where brothers and sisters of all folds and species and kinds are united through the ultimate, the infinite, the loving one.</li>
          <br />
          <li>My favorite thing of all things is, undoubtedly, story. But only because the idea of story is not limited to words on a page or images on a screen. Do you not know that your mind is the author and your body the pen? And underlying all of these tangled characters, a master writer is present, composing eloquently the story of Life as we know it now. And thank everything you've ever known that Life is not what you expect, because if it was then it would be far from what it actually is - perfection. Do you hear the music in all things? The spirit behind the strum of the guitar. The emotion behind the eternal gaze of two lovers. The story behind the life of the individual.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Every footstep of yours is a note, your life a symphony.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Oh with what swift and precise words I long to clarify the pangs of my heart. Only a reality as sadistic as sin could turn those that it possesses into such selfish blindness that they see the <i>root</i> of the problem of the world in one of themselves. The truth is that we are God's. But sin cursed that heavenly ownership. So we are all on the same team from the start, born drenched in sin, in brokenness, and the problem is sin, is evil, is anything not done in accordance with faith in God. Because God is telling a story through creation. And I believe that in the next life when we have all died and faded from these contoured sacks of flesh, one thing of truth of life on earth may be said: "This is what happens when you don't listen to God." A loving father knows what is best for his children, wants what is best for his children, provides what is best for his children. And in this reality of sin, God seeks to save us from the void of evil that we have given our hearts and minds and souls over to by redemption in Him through His Son, Jesus Christ. One of many points being: we are ALL ON THE SAME SIDE HERE. IT IS SIN THAT DIVIDES US AGAINST EACH OTHER. WE COULD BE CO-CONSPIRATORS ALL ON A RIGHTEOUS PATH TO TRUTH AND JUSTICE AND LOVE AND LIGHT BUT BEHOLD AS IT IS WRITTEN - HUMANS LOVED THE DARKNESS MORE.

      <h2><u>PART 7 - CONCLUSION</u></h2>
      <p>And a conclusion of sorts. May God bless you on your journey!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have to trust that God's will is so much greater for you and everything about you than your own will for your life and who you think you want to become.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Call it cliché. Call it unrealistic. Call it whatever you want but I call it truth - the only thing limiting you is yourself.</li>
        <br />
        <li>It is from a deep realization of the evil in the people around me and in myself that I must cling to the goodness in my life. Lord Jesus, come quickly and may the vengeance that is yours be absolute and devastating to all sin.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Just as the earth orbits the sun, so too are we meant to orbit other persons, as creatures borne in the image of God, who is an eternal perfect state of orbiting distinct persons within Himself. Sin is self-centeredness. Trying to get everything or anything to orbit around you. Trying to be the center of the moment. You only realize the fullness of true love and true life when you give the moment to someone else, to God. For in loving others, we love God, for God is selfless love.</li>
        <br />
        <li>"Did you hear me and do you think that any of it mattered"</li>
        <br />
        <li>Get to know Jesus Christ and if you cannot find the motivation in yourself to do that than at least do that thing you've always wanted to do RIGHT NOW, because these days pass by like a shadow.</li>
        <br />
        <li>If we remembered the truth of the foresight and foreknowledge that God has, we too would see the vanity of this world. God holds the keys to eternity and whatever is with Him will make it.</li>
        <br />
        <li>All life is an attempt to share the joy found in the love of God.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Faith is perfect because nothing is overtly forced. Service is voluntary never mandated.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Invariably, the naturalistic response will be reluctance. Many may believe that people ought to pursue "whatever makes them happy" or "contribute to society" or "do what's right for themselves". But these paths are foolishness in and of themselves because what makes a person happy is relative, any contribution to society that a human makes is negated by the immense corruption and evil that is a staple of life on Earth soaked in sin, and who knows what is right for oneself? Happiness is a transitory state of mind that ebbs and flows and death knocks it down forever. Think of your ancestors and the great characters of the past. Where is their happiness now? Society is a transitory state of human life that ebbs and flows and death knocks it down forever. Think of your ancestors and the great civilizations of the past. Where is their glory now? Think about the many paths and decisions and choices one makes in one's life. The "best choices" can lead to total destruction of the individual and the "worst choices" can lead to total fulfillment of the individual. Who knows what is right in general? Who knows what is right for a person? We are all caught up with ourselves and our current fixation of self-narrative, whether we know it or not. Many of us worry for the future, stress about the present, and regret the past, whether it is conscious or subconscious. The point I want to make is this: Think of your ancestors and the billions and billions of people that have been born, lived, laughed, cried, talked, and died. Where is their fear for the future, their stress for the present, and their troublesome past? Death knocks it down, and we fear over nothing. That's why the gift of life is the present moment, no matter where you are. If you have the right heart and stance about life, you can actually be in awe of the depth of beauty around you, and be genuine and joyful for the now. Because the key to remember is that the now is slipping away and fast and before you know it, you'll be either dead or dying, and you'll think crazy thoughts like "how did I get here?" and "where did all the time go?" and "did I live a life that I can honestly be proud of?" and "did I love my family well, my friends well, and even my enemies, did I love them well?" and "was I filled with confusion and hate and disdain for others or rather clarity and love and forgiveness for others?". Questions like these will scrape across your mind at some point, whether consciously or subconsciously, and you will either answer with glee, answer with regret, or refuse to respond out of fear for exposing the truth, which is, of course, that you were not your best self. But that's life. That's life.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>I looked into the dead eyes of my brothers and sisters and from deep within their hearts they cried out with despair, declaring "ugliness, ugliness, behold, this world is ugliness" but I solemnly stared back at them, befuddled with a grimace in my heart, masking my befuddlement of them with a smile on my face though, swearing from my soul "but we see what we are, and the greatest pair of eyes is beautiful, I promise". But in their vanity they heard nothing and perished without a reasonable word, no more. They were no more.</li>
        <br />
        <li>All of us are searching, whether we know it or not. And you will search and search and drink of every possible thing that can fill you up in the interim. You will fill yourself up on morsels of scraps, not knowing that the opportunity to feast is always within you and around you and especially above you. You will go down many paths, confident that their end will justify your journey, forgetting that there is only one thing that matters - love - and there is only one example of true love - Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. All else is illusion, distraction, destruction - in place to deter you from connecting to who you were created to connect with. I wonder how long it will take you to realize that the waters of the world that you continually drink of - be it your significant other, your body, your social status or circle, your income, your career, your contribution to society, your selfish selflessness, your vainglory, your hatred of those different than you, your lack of empathy for every individual who is walking through life beside you, or some other drained well - before it is clear that ALL OF THE ABOVE WILL LEAD TO DEATH IF YOU MAKE ANY OF IT YOUR PRIORITY. THERE IS ONE PATH TO LIFE, ONE PERSON THAT THIS GREAT STORY OF LIFE IS ALL ABOUT AND IT IS NOT YOU BUT YOU ARE ALONG FOR THE RIDE, THE ONLY ISSUE IS WHETHER YOU ARE WITH OR AGAINST THE PROTAGONIST OF ALL CREATION, THE RECIPIENT OF ALL MOCKERY AND THE OBJECT OF ALL SCOFFERS, THE PROVIDER OF LASTING RICHES, THE LOVER OF SINNERS, THE PRIEST OF THE FALLEN, THE GUIDE FOR THE BROKEN-HEARTED, THE CREATOR OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH, THE LISTENER OF SORROWS, THE ANSWER TO ALL PRAYERS, THE FUEL OF ALL LIFE, THE GUARANTOR OF TRUTH - of course, I am talking about Jesus Christ who you will either recognize as King in this life in good graces or the next, at the mercy of His will.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>But there is one exception to all of this confusion. There is a constant love, a consistent force of good at work behind all things. Just because its methods are unexpected does not mean that they are not sound. Good will supplant bad in the end. It is only because grace is abounding in the present that evil exists and falsely appears to reign. There will come a day where evil reaches its inevitable fatality. It is true beyond nature that humans are not exempt from that fateful day. Listen to your heart that has been given to you by God, of God.</li>
        <br />
        <li>If you're reading this right now, then I desperately want you to understand what I'm saying. And all I'm saying is this: Life is amazing. God is good. And a life lived with the knowledge of the depth of love and grace of God is the ultimate way to live a spectacular life.</li>
        <br />
        <li>why people don't choose him: lack of faith/want of the world (see Romans 6)</li>
        <li>
          <p>First, there is a mind, an identity, a self. And that self is divinely ordained a purpose, either his own or His own. Regardless, His purpose prevailed, is prevailing, and will prevail. But to each his own purpose, respectively. Some degree of free will is necessary, for, if otherwise, we have no or zero control over our lives. There is one. And then there are divisions within that oneness of a particular nature that are manifested in reality. And all endeavors of and in life reflect the established nature of the Almighty One. And the Almighty One used, is using, and will use the endeavors of all created beings who have been given the breath of life, for His Holy Endeavor, which is just and good and love and true to Him and His nature and His character. Because of the terrifying and human-defying power of Him, along with His good will and perfect authorship, God speaks to us through everything – the cliché and blatant of which are His Word, prayer, and people. To the degree that God sees fit, and insofar as the state of one’s heart is in tune with the music of God, the eyes and ears of an individual may discern the voice of God, or what He wants to do and be for us, if we let Him. What is necessary then is that the individual recognizes the sheer and real depravity and vanity of self-centered life, as opposed to God-centered life.

            <li>The self must realize and understand its natural inability to sustain itself and to survive on its own.</li>
            <li>The self must see and experience a higher degree of living.</li>
            <li>The self must see and experience how desperately it seeks to lift up its identity, no matter what faith system it is currently adhering to.</li>

        <li>It is key to understand that what you put your identity in gives you value. So you put your identity in _____? What will you do when _____ comes to an end?

    <h1>The Book of Ecclesiastes</h1>

    <div id="echapter1" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 1 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 1</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>All Is Vanity</i></u></h6>
      <p>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.</p>
      <p>What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?</p>
      <p>A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.</p>
      <p>The sun rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where it rises.</p>
      <p>The wind blows to the south and goes around to the north; around and around goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns.</p>
      <p>All streams run to the sea, but the sea is not full; to the place where the streams flow, there they flow again.</p>
      <p>All things are full of weariness; a man cannot utter it; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</p>
      <p>What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun.</p>
      <p>Is there a thing of which it is said, "See, this is new"? It has been already in the ages before us.</p>
      <p>There is no remembrance of former things, nor will there be any remembrance of later things yet to be among those who come after.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Wisdom</i></u></h6>
      <p>I the Preacher have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven. It is an unhappy business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.</p>
      <p>I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a striving after the wind.</p>
      <p>What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted.</p>
      <p>I said in my heart, "I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."</p>
      <p>And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind.</p>
      <p>For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="echapter2" class="ecclesiastes_content">
    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 2 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 2</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Self-Indulgence</i></u></h6>
      <p>I said in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself." But behold, this also was vanity.</p>
      <p>I said of laughter, "It is mad," and of pleasure, "What use is it?"</p>
      <p>I searched with my heart how to cheer my body with wine - my heart still guiding me with wisdom - and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the children of man to do under heaven during the few days of their life.</p>
      <p>I made great works. I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.</p>
      <p>I made myself gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.</p>
      <p>I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees.</p>
      <p>I bought male and female slaves, and had slaves who were born in my house. I had also great possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I got singers, both men and women, and many concubines, the delight of the sons of man.</p>
      <p>So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me.</p>
      <p>And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my reward for all my toil.</p>
      <p>Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Living Wisely</i></u></h6>
      <p>So I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly. For what can man do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done.</p>
      <p>Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness.</p>
      <p>The wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that the same event happens to all of them.</p>
      <p>Then I said in my heart, "What happens to the fool will happen to me also. Why then have I been so very wise?" And I said in my heart that this also is vanity.</p>
      <p>For of the wise as of the fool there is no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. How the wise dies just like the fool!</p>
      <p>So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for all is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Toil</i></u></h6>
      <p>I hated all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who will come after me,</p>
      <p>and who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.</p>
      <p>So I turned about and gave my heart up to despair over all the toil of my labors under the sun,</p>
      <p>because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.</p>
      <p>What has a man from all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun?</p>
      <p>For all his days are full of sorrow, and his work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.</p>
      <p>There is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God,</p>
      <p>for apart from him who can eat or who can have enjoyment?</p>
      <p>For to the one who pleases him God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given the business of gathering and collecting, only to give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>

    <h6><u><i>A Time for Everything</i></u></h6>
      <p>For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:</p>
      <p>a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;</p>
      <p>a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</p>
      <p>a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</p>
      <p>a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</p>
      <p>a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</p>
      <p>a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</p>
      <p>a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The God-Given Task</i></u></h6>
      <p>What gain has the worker from his toil?</p>
      <p>I have seen the business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.</p>
      <p>He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man's heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.</p>
      <p>I perceived that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live;</p>
      <p>also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil - this is God's gift to man.</p>
      <p>I perceived that whatever God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God has done it, so that people fear before him.</p>
      <p>That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already has been; and God seeks what has been driven away.</p>
    <h6><u><i>From Dust to Dust</i></u></h6>
      <p>Moreover, I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, even there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness, even there was wickedness.</p>
      <p>I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work.</p>
      <p>I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but beasts.</p>
      <p>For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity.</p>
      <p>All go to one place. All are from the dust, and to dust all return.</p>
      <p>Who knows whether the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of the beast goes down into the earth?</p>
      <p>So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his work, for that is his lot. Who can bring him to see what will be after him?</p>

    <h6><u><i>Evil Under the Sun</i></u></h6>
      <p>Again I saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power, and there was no one to comfort them.</p>
      <p>And I thought the dead who are already dead more fortunate than the living who are still alive.</p>
      <p>But better than both is he who has not yet been and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.</p>
      <p>Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man's envy of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
      <p>The fool folds his hands and eats his own flesh.</p>
      <p>Better is a handful of quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind.</p>
      <p>Again, I saw vanity under the sun:</p>
      <p>one person who has no other, either son or brother, yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks, "For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?" This also is vanity and an unhappy business.</p>
      <p>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil.</p>
      <p>For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up!</p>
      <p>Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone?</p>
      <p>And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him - a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>
      <p>Better was a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knew how to take advice.</p>
      <p>For he went from prison to the throne, though in his own kingdom he had been born poor.</p>
      <p>I saw all the living who move about under the sun, along with that youth who was to stand in the king's place.</p>
      <p>There was no end of all the people, all of whom he led. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>

    <h6><u><i>Fear God</i></u></h6>
      <p>Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. To draw near to listen is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil.</p>
      <p>Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore let your words be few.</p>
      <p>For a dream comes with much business, and a fool's voice with many words.</p>
      <p>When you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it, for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow.</p>
      <p>It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.</p>
      <p>Let not your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?</p>
      <p>For when dreams increase and words grow many, there is vanity; but God is the one you must fear.</p>
    <h6><u><i>The Vanity of Wealth and Honor</i></u></h6>
      <p>If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and righteousness, do not be amazed at the matter, for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them.</p>
      <p>But this is gain for a land in every way: a king committed to cultivated fields.</p>
      <p>He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity.</p>
      <p>When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes?</p>
      <p>Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.</p>
      <p>There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt,</p>
      <p>and those riches were lost in a bad venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand.</p>
      <p>As he came from his mother's womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand.</p>
      <p>This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what gain is there to him who toils for the wind?</p>
      <p>Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger.</p>
      <p>Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his lot.</p>
      <p>Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil - this is the gift of God.</p>
      <p>For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.</p>

    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 6</u></h4>
      <p>There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy on mankind:</p>
      <p>a man to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to enjoy them, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity; it is a grievous evil.</p>
      <p>If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with life's good things, and he also has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.</p>
      <p>For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness, and in darkness its name is covered.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it has not seen the sun or known anything, yet it finds rest rather than he.</p>
      <p>Even though he should live a thousand years twice over, yet enjoy no good - do not all go to the one place?</p>
      <p>All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied.</p>
      <p>For what advantage has the wise man over the fool? And what does the poor man have who knows how to conduct himself before the living?</p>
      <p>Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the appetite: this also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
      <p>Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what man is, and that he is not able to dispute with one stronger than he.</p>
      <p>The more words, the more vanity, and what is the advantage to man?</p>
      <p>For who knows what is good for man while he lives the few days of his vain life, which he passes like a shadow? For who can tell man what will be after him under the sun?</p>

    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 7</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>The Contrast of Wisdom and Folly</i></u></h6>
      <p>A good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of birth.</p>
      <p>It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for this is the end of all mankind, and the living will lay it to heart.</p>
      <p>Sorrow is better than laughter, for by sadness of face the heart is made glad.</p>
      <p>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</p>
      <p>It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise than to hear the song of fools.</p>
      <p>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fools; this also is vanity.</p>
      <p>Surely oppression drives the wise into madness, and a bribe corrupts the heart.</p>
      <p>Better is the end of a thing than its beginning, and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</p>
      <p>Be not quick in your spirit to become angry, for anger lodges in the heart of fools.</p>
      <p>Say not, "Why were the former days better than these?" For it is not from wisdom that you ask this.</p>
      <p>Wisdom is good with an inheritance, an advantage to those who see the sun.</p>
      <p>For the protection of wisdom is like the protection of money, and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.</p>
      <p>Consider the work of God: who can make straight what he has made crooked?</p>
      <p>In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.</p>
      <p>In my vain life I have seen everything. There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evildoing.</p>
      <p>Be not overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?</p>
      <p>Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool. Why should you die before your time?</p>
      <p>It is good that you should take hold of this, and from that withhold not your hand, for the one who fears God shall come out from both of them.</p>
      <p>Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.</p>
      <p>Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.</p>
      <p>Do not take to heart all the things that people say, lest you hear your servant cursing you.</p>
      <p>Your heart knows that many times you yourself have cursed others.</p>
      <p>All this I have tested by wisdom. I said, "I will be wise," but it was far from me.</p>
      <p>That which has been is far off, and deep, very deep; who can find it out?</p>
      <p>I turned my heart to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness that is madness.</p>
      <p>And I find something more bitter than death: the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is taken by her.</p>
      <p>Behold, this is what I found, says the Preacher, while adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things -</p>
      <p>which my soul has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. One man among a thousand I found, but a woman among all these I have not found.</p>
      <p>See, this alone I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.</p>

    <!-- Ecclesiastes chapter 8 -->
    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 8</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>Keep the King's Command</i></u></h6>
      <p>Who is like the wise? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.</p>
      <p>I say: Keep the king's command, because of God's oath to him.</p>
      <p>Be not hasty to go from his presence. Do not take your stand in an evil cause, for he does whatever he pleases.</p>
      <p>For the word of the king is supreme, and who may say to him, "What are you doing?"</p>
      <p>Whoever keeps a command will know no evil thing, and the wise heart will know the proper time and the just way.</p>
      <p>For there is a time and a way for everything, although man's trouble lies heavy on him.</p>
      <p>For he does not know what is to be, for who can tell him how it will be?</p>
      <p>No man has power to retain the spirit, or power over the day of death. There is no discharge from war, nor will wickedness deliver those who are given to it.</p>
      <p>All this I observed while applying my heart to all that is done under the sun, when man had power over man to his hurt.</p>
    <h6><u><i>Those Who Fear God Will Do Well</i></u></h6>
      <p>Then I saw the wicked buried. They used to go in and out of the holy place and were praised in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity.</p>
      <p>Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the children of man is fully set to do evil.</p>
      <p>Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I know that it will be well with those who fear God, because they fear before him.</p>
      <p>But it will not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong his days like a shadow, because he does not fear before God.</p>
    <h6><u><i>Man Cannot Know God's Ways</i></u></h6>
      <p>There is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.</p>
      <p>And I commend joy, for man has nothing better under the sun but to eat and drink and be joyful, for this will go with him in his toil through the days of his life that God has given him under the sun.</p>
      <p>When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on earth, how neither day nor night do one's eyes see sleep,</p>
      <p>then I saw all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. However much man may toil in seeking, he will not find it out. Even though a wise man claims to know, he cannot find it out.</p>

    <h4><u>Ecclesiastes 9</u></h4>
    <h6><u><i>Death Comes to All</i></u></h6>
      <p>But all this I laid to heart, examing it all, how the righteous and the wise and their deeds are in the hand of God. Whether it is love or hate, man does not know; both are before him.</p>
      <p>It is the same for all, since the same event happens to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil, to the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As the good one is, so is the sinner, and he who swears is as he who shuns an oath.</p>
      <p>This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that the same event happens to all. Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</p>
      <p>But he who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</p>
      <p>For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.</p>
      <p>Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished, and forever they have no more share in all that is done under the sun.</p>
    <h6><u><i>Enjoy Life with the One You Love</i></u></h6>
      <p>Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved what you do.</p>
      <p>Let your garments be always white. Let not oil be lacking on your head.</p>
      <p>Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life that he has given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun.</p>
      <p>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might, for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.</p>
    <h6><u><i>Wisdom Better Than Folly</i></u></h6>
      <p>Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and chance happen to them all.</p>
      <p>For man does not know his time. Like fish that are taken in an evil net, and like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of man are snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them.</p>
      <p>I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.</p>
      <p>There was a little city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged it, building great siegeworks against it.</p>
      <p>But there was found in it a poor, wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that poor man.</p>
      <p>But I say that wisdom is better than might, though the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard.</p>
      <p>The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.</p>
      <p>Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.</p>

      <p>A wise man's heart inclines him to the right, but a fool's heart to the left.</p>
      <p>Even when the fool walks on the road, he lacks sense, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.</p>
      <p>If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place, for calmness will lay great offenses to rest.</p>
      <p>There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were an error proceeding from the ruler:</p>
      <p>folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place.</p>
      <p>I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking on the ground like slaves.</p>
      <p>He who digs a pit will fall into it, and a serpent will bite him who breaks through a wall.</p>
      <p>He who quarries stones is hurt by them, and he who splits logs is endangered by them.</p>
      <p>If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge, he must use more strength, but wisdom helps one to succeed.</p>
      <p>If the serpent bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the charmer.</p>
      <p>The words of a wise man's mouth win him favor, but the lips of a fool consume him.</p>
      <p>The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is evil madness.</p>
      <p>A fool multiplies words, though no man knows what is to be, and who can tell him what will be after him?</p>
      <p>The toil of a fool wearies him, for he does not know the way to the city.</p>
      <p>Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes feast in the morning!</p>
      <p>Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of the nobility, and your princes feast at the proper time, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</p>
      <p>Through sloth the roof sinks in, and through indolence the house leaks.</p>
      <p>Bread is made for laughter, and wine gladdens life, and money answers everything.</p>

    <p>If you're reading this, then it means that I love you deeply on a level that is difficult to articulate through human limitations, much less human language. I am heartbroken that I haven't the time to get to know you better. If you need anything, please get in touch and I will see what I can do.</p>
    <p>But instead of the above, how about I just say, "How you been?"</p>
    <p>Let me know how you been!</p>
    <p>My number is: (512)-409-4224</p>
    <p>My e-mail address is: baxterhoward99@gmail.com</p>
    <p>If you have something you want to say, about literally anything, know that if you let me, I will listen to you and in full. And you will be able to trust that an understanding ear is hearing any words and worries you have with care. I know it is human nature to shy away from being vulnerable, and I know there is a chasm of unknown ground between us, but my offer still stands. I am here. There is no shame or reservation in a dialogue between two true friends that seek the good will of the other.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Are you blissfully joyful? I have been there, I am there, and I will be there.</p>
    <p>Are you tragically messed up? Seriously depressed? I have been there, I am there, and I will be there.</p>
    <p>I feel that same simultaneous joy and terror for existence, that ongoing play between liberation and bondage within our boxed in souls.</p>
    <p>Wherever your heart is, I want you to know that I have been there too, that I understand, that it's okay, but it's time to get a hold of yourself and wake up tomorrow a better person, in the eyes of those who matter.</p>
    <p>What I am telling you is that there is a deep brokenness to us and our hearts and I want you to know - truly - that you are not alone when you are in the throes of the ocean, at the mercy of the waves, when you are in the jungle of the amazon, unknown danger surrounding you, when you are so heartbroken and downtrodden that you want death over life, when you are drowning in pain, when you are hurting with injustice, when you let loneliness injure you, when you feel unheard, when you screw up beyond your wildest imagination, when you feel like you are stuck at the bottom of the sea and there is no one around you in the darkness - you are not alone. I have been there, friend. And I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. You need not suffer any longer. I love you. And I want pure joy and goodness to fuel your heart forevermore. And when we have both risen from it all, if indeed your soul is covered by the truth of Jesus Christ, I cannot wait to rejoice beside you, basking in all the untapped goodness and beauty that is in you.
    </p>
    <p>"When you fail, remember that God understands our pain and suffering. He lived it. He is infinitely understanding and always willing to forgive you - just lean with all your might on His Word!"</p>
    <p>This way through the wilderness. Hurry. I love you.</p>
    <p>And if for some reason I'm not available, Our Heavenly Father is just a prayer away. I AM HERE. I AM ON YOUR SIDE. I UNDERSTAND. I FORGIVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. NOW I WANT YOU TO MAKE IT HOME SAFELY. QUICKLY NOW, THIS WAY THROUGH THE BRUSH.</p>
    <p>There was a knock at the door. It was the Lord. I opened it, uncertain of what I would find. "Behold," said the Lord. "It is I. I see you are my neighbor in this world. I happen to know there is a storm coming that will uproot every home and person that is not within my walls, and it is brewing at this very moment. I urge you with love and in love to join me at my mansion, where I have prepared a room, just for you. I want you to be there desperately, but, ultimately, the choice is yours."</p>
    <p>Oh how amazing it is to breathe with a blessed breath of life, and to begin to fully understand the bliss of every fabric of experience.</p>
    <p>Blessed be the Lord Jesus Christ. And blessed be those that seek and do reflect His character and goodness.</p>

    <h1>The Great Deception</h1>
    <p>Now I wish I had the time to present the content of this website (and this specific section) in a better way visually, but again, I must press that I am short on time. So this current section at the bottom will have to suffice.</p>
    <p>Here is the truth of our situation in this world...</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Will someone please turn the lights on in here?</p>
    <p>Would someone please turn on the lights in this world of darkness?</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Are you sure you want to know the truth about our world? Here it is, whether you believe it or not, right here below these words - the answer to why our world is the way it is.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Truly, I tell you, we have all been deceived.</p>
    <p>And it all traces back to us not listening to the Lord God.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>The world is so much more dark and so absolutely corrupt and so bathed and baked with evil that if we knew the true extent of it, we would be so utterly horrified that death would seem like a walk in the park comparatively.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Now the truth about this world is a lot to handle - so much so, that your initial reaction will likely be to one, reject it (because it is easier to believe as you have been programmed to believe), or two, minimize it (because it is easier to downplay the immense horror which has us all in chains).</p>
    <p>This is it: the current world is temporarily in the hands of Satan. Satan has many names - Satan, Lucifer, the Devil, the evil one, the father of lies. But suffice it to say that he is an angel who started and led a rebellion against God, and because of Satan's adherence to his delusion, God cast him and all who followed him down and out.</p>
    <p>Here's the kicker: there are a lot of different names for the group of people I am trying to identify before you, but a broadly-defined secular term would be "elites". There are, and always have been, a group of people who "run the world" and have <i>immense</i> power and influence over pretty much everything on earth. They control and have power over money and the flow of money, the success of individuals in entertainment and other industries, the instigation of wars across the globe, and, like you wouldn't believe, propaganda to the most sinister and hidden degree.</p>
    <p>But here is what people wouldn't believe - as you get higher and higher on the totem pole of elites, at the highest order, you have literal "Luciferians". "Lucifer" was the name of Satan before he fell. At the upper echelon of these elites, they would call themselves something to the effect of "Luciferians", because this name gives reverence to "Lucifer" who is, of course, in reality, "Satan". This is what people would not believe. People do not just gain power and influence coming from nowhere. People are offered immense power or influence or wealth or fame or all of the aforementioned because Satan gives it to them.</p>
    <p>And we know Satan has control over our world because of when Satan tempted Jesus.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p><u>Matthew 4:8-11</u></p>
    <p>Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to him, "All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me."</p>
    <p>Then Jesus said to him,</p>
    <p class=redletters>"Be gone, Satan! For it is written, "You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"</p>
    <p>Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>But if you do not believe in the veracity of the bible, may you realize that, even from afar, we all know that <i>there is <b>something wrong</b> with this world</i>. I'm telling you the truth - that something is called "the condition of sin", and we fell into it because we disobeyed God by obeying Satan.</p>
    <p>So, let us do a quick recap.</p>
    <p>#1: Satan currently holds the reigns on this beast of an earth.</p>
    <p>#2: People who exert the current greatest power and influence on the face of the earth literally worship Satan.</p>
    <p>Okay, so another name for the church of Satan is the "Occult".</p>
    <p>Occult means "hidden".
    <p>Which is what Satanists are all about - they keep their works in the dark, thinking that no one sees or hears them, and laughing at what they get away with.</p>
    <p><b>Anyone</b> who does significant research into the actual occult, and the symbols which are affiliated with the occult, the following becomes obvious - the occult is <i>everywhere</i>.</p>
    <p>LISTEN TO THIS - IT IS SO VITAL THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THIS. Essentially every form of media (pop music, movies, television, and especially all 'news' organizations) across the globe, every government of every country, every well-known corporation and company of all kinds, and most people of significant fame in the "hollywood" arena are of the occult, have ties to the occult, or, at the very least, are, for lack of a better word, slaves to the occult.</p>
    <p>For example, just look at the names of modern television shows and blockbuster films. The darkness they are deceiving us all with can even be seen in the very names and titles of the entertainment they throw at us.</p>
    <p>I swear, whoever you are reading this, once you take the time to sit back and observe all of modern entertainment, especially in the context of the values and good of Jesus Christ, and on top of everything you are able to see how the symbols of the occult (remember, this is the literal, actual, for real Lucifer-worshiping satanic church) are in so so so many corporations, organizations, forms of media, and entertainment, there is no denying that there is a serious anti-Christ agenda going on in the world. I know. It sounds crazy. I imagine you may think I'm a "conspiracy theory nutcase" now, or something. I don't care. Please do the research for yourself. Because I promise, if you take the time to actually investigate the literature of the occult, and the symbols and agendas affiliated with the occult, and you compare that information with the state of affairs in our world right now (in 2018), it's a match. Luciferians genuinely believe in the evil that they do, and because Satan is in control of this world right now, his followers are given immense power and influence and they are using it effectively on the mass population - you and me, us, regular people who don't know any better.
    </p>
    <p>But if seeing the suggestive names and titles of television shows and songs is not obvious enough for revealing their agenda to you, just look at the values that are promoted. There is a serious agenda going on with pretty much all entertainment and any form of anything that can consistently reach YOU - film, television, music, news, government, public education, and much more. And this is especially confirmed once you realize how the industries are run aka the values they have, and how everything is controlled by few and powerful companies/people. It's all a sickly sinister show, a myriad of sounds and images meant to sway the mind of the unfortunate observers, in order to genuinely accomplish the agenda of the elite, which is to rewrite history and truth and love and good and people as they see fit. And achieve greatness all on their own. And if you don't believe any of that. If the truth is too far out for you at this time, then you can at least see how this is true: even if they were not using all outlets of media for propaganda, they are surely using all outlets of media to DISTRACT you. There is an old saying and it is too true when it comes to this world we are in. "You can control the masses if you provide for them bread and circus - food and entertainment." And I don't know about you, but here in America, that's about all we are given - all across this land too many minds have fallen for the entrapments of our totally food-and-entertainment-saturated environment. Seriously. Look around you. Food and entertainment and we are theirs and they have SUCCEEDED in duping us so. They have surrounded us with food and entertainment because they want us to be dumb and ignorant and under their thumb and under their control, and they want us to idly sit by doing nothing of worth while they accomplish their quite literal devilish plan. They want to distract you from ever waking up from the cycle of vanity they have you in, finally seeing how this world is a joke because it's in the hands of tormented and delusional souls who think they will get ahead of the Lord God. And it is written they will get relatively far. But their success will not last for long at all. THIS IS ALL IN THE BIBLE - IT WOULD DO US ALL WELL TO READ AND UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH IN THE BIBLE BECAUSE WHAT IS IN THAT BOOK IS ABOUT THE ONLY REAL THING THERE IS IN THIS SINFUL WORLD. ALL ELSE IS VANITY UNTIL AT THE APPOINTED TIME THE LORD GOD SAYS ENOUGH AND POURS OUT HIS WRATH AND ESTABLISHES THE NEW KINGDOM WITH JESUS CHRIST AS THE TRUE KING, OUR RIGHTEOUS SAVIOR.
    </p>
    <p>But soon the Lord God will come in righteousness and establish actual truth in this land.</p>
    <p>PLEASE DO NOT JUST BRUSH THIS OFF AS SOME CRAZY THING NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. DO YOUR RESEARCH ON YOUR OWN - THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO ALL OF THE ABOVE.</p>
    <p>I'm just saying. If I had great global power and influence, and I wanted to trick people without them ever realizing it was a trick, then I would manipulate public perception and societal portrayal so that those that were onto the truth of the trick - "those old crazy conspiracy theorists" - as total nutcases. "Oh that's crazy, you really believe that? That's so out there, that's just not possible," is what I would want everyone to say and think toward the people actually onto something. (Truly, I tell you, this is what has been done. The truth of all of this is supported if you investigate it for yourself. For example, YouTube - which is Google - which is a company with logos containing 666 among other things - consistently takes action to demonize and diminish the work and popularity of YouTube channels which discuss and educate people on certain "conspiracy theories". And then it goes on to funnel and promote and support what is clearly occult-oriented music, secular entertainers, and other distractors that accomplish their agenda.)
    </p>

    <p>And remember, we can confirm that a lot of this darkness is happening in our world because of the <b>hidden</b> (occult) symbolism in so many aspects of global culture.</p>
    <p>If your first reaction is to deny the truth of this, then I beg you to reconsider...</p>
    <p>The bible says that Satan is the one who "deceives the whole world". That he is the "father of lies". And "the great deceiver".</p>
    <p>Don't you think that there is a chance that Satan could pull a fast one on all of us?</p>
    <p>Indeed, I tell you, he already has.</p>
    <p>I strongly encourage you to investigate all of the claims that I am making in this section yourself, because I believe the evidence points to its truth - Satan is currently in control of the world, Satan is very talented at deceiving people, and Satan uses all arms of society - government for control, media for propaganda, money for corruption, entertainment for distraction, and a lot of other things to manipulate people to do his will.</p>
    <p>And the Satanists who rule this world are all working toward one thing - a global government which will then allow one figure to swoop in and quite literally rule the entire world.</p>
    <p>What is astonishing about all of this is that the bible prophecies all of this madness.</p>
    <p>This person (or figure) which swoops in to save the day and wow all of humanity - this person will be the antichrist.</p>
    <p>The antichrist and those with him will be granted power to perform amazing and awe-inspiring miracles and signs. These miracles and signs and the magnetic character of the antichrist <i>will deceive many into believing the antichrist</i>. As in, people will see him, the antichrist, and see his miracles, and they will believe that he, the antichrist, is God.</p>
    <p>BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE, though surely the whole world will think it is - because the whole world will be blown away by the actions that the antichrist performs.</p>
    <p>THE TRUTH IS THIS: JESUS CHRIST, THE LORD GOD OF THE HOLY BIBLE, IS THE ONE TRUE GOD</p>.
    <p>This deception that will take place has its roots in biblical history:</p>
    <p>The Lord God of the Holy Bible is the true way and the true light and the actual truth.</p>
    <p>And Satan is convinced that he, Satan, is superior to the actual truth.</p>
    <p>This is a flat-out lie.</p>
    <p>And no one has been more deceived than those who serve Lucifer. For little do they know, that the only card he has is evil, the only word he has is a lie, and the light that, a long time ago, was in him, was only there because of the will of the true light, the brighter and mightier Lord Almighty.</p>
    <p>But in order for Satan to try to experience this delusion he has, Satan tries to imitate the true Lord God.</p>
    <p>This is why the antichrist will arrive promising peace and love - and many people will like the sound of this, because true peace and true love are actually good things that are from the great and true Lord God.</p>
    <p>But what people will not understand is that the antichrist is lying to them. He is promising a <i>false</i> peace and a <i>false</i> love. But because people do not know the truth (Jesus Christ), they will fall for the antichrist and believe his many lies.</p>
    <p>This is one of the reasons why it is imperative that you come to know the truth - that you come to have a relationship with Jesus Christ. Believing in Him will set you free in so many ways. You will not be under the spells of the antichrist, or any of Satan's lies.</p>
    <p>But, alas, amazing things will happen on the face of the earth. The antichrist will receive a deadly wound to the head, and the world will mourn for him. But then, miraculously, he will come back to life. The antichrist will come back from the dead and will quickly declare himself as God. Many, many, many will be deceived.</p>
    <p>But the true Lord God will only let this abomination last for a short time, and soon Jesus Christ will return to earth and defeat the evil one and all who are aligned with the evil one with grace and ease.</p>
    <p>But until that glorious day, Satan's spells of deceit continue to work deception in the minds of everyone he can reach.</p>
    <p>FOR TRULY I TELL YOU - SATAN KNOWS THAT YOU ARE SAVED BY BELIEVING IN CHRIST. AND HE USES THIS VALUABLE INFORMATION TO HIS ADVANTAGE IN DECEPTION - HE IS EVIL AND HATES YOU. HE SINISTERLY LAYS TRAPS FOR YOUR MIND SO TO KEEP YOU DISTRACTED FROM THE TRUTH, KEEP YOU PUTTING FAITH IN WHAT ARE ACTUALLY LIES, KEEP YOU AVOIDING CHRIST AND SALVATION. IT IS HORRIBLE WHEN YOU REALIZE THE FOLLOWING - EVERY FACET OF THIS CURRENT WORLD IS TRYING TO DECEIVE YOU - TO DECREASE THE VALUE OF CHRIST, INCREASE THE VALUE OF FALSE GOOD, FALSE TRUTH, FALSE TEACHING, FALSE GODS, FALSE LOVE, FALSE PEACE, AND EVERY FALSEHOOD POSSIBLE. SATAN, TRULY THE PRINCE OF THIS CURRENT WORLD, IS SELFISH AND SELF-SERVING AND WANTS YOU TO BE THE SAME - LIKE HIM. HE WANTS TO DRAG AS MANY PEOPLE DOWN TO THE RESERVED PUNISHMENTS FOR EVIL WITH HIM AND, TRAGICALLY, IT IS KNOWN THAT HE WILL SUCCEED WITH MANY. DO NOT BE COUNTED AMONG THE MANY WHO ARE SPIRITUALLY BLIND.</p>
    <p>SIMPLY AND HONESTLY BELIEVE IN THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST AND YOU WILL BE SAVED.</p>
    <p>And such is our tragedy, the blindfold locked over our eyes - no one has the key but Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>So please, for your sake, I strongly encourage you to not just casually brush off what I have written in this section of this site. All of what I have said here is very real and the evil too awful. God tried to warn us the first time around, but we failed to listen. Do not fail to listen this time around - believe in Jesus Christ, and call upon His name, and you will be saved.</p>
    <p>The bible says everything will change in a moment...and then the time of the antichrist will usher in for seven years.</p>
    <p>DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THAT MOMENT. YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE ON EARTH WHEN THE ANTICHRIST IS REIGNING IF YOU BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST (AND YOU MUST IF YOU CARE FOR THE SALVATION OF YOUR SOUL). THOSE WHO CALL ON THE NAME OF CHRIST IN THOSE DAYS WILL BE PERSECUTED AND KILLED FOR CONFESSING JESUS CHRIST AS LORD. BELIEVE BEFORE YOU MUST DEAL WITH SUCH EVIL.</p>
    <p>The bible also says that there will be a great deception when the time of the antichrist ushers in.</p>
    <p>No one knows with absolute certainty what exactly this great deception is, but many Christ-believers are speculating that it could be a staged "alien invasion", where the antichrist or the "aliens" claim to be the creator/s of humanity, and that what will be happening next is a change in human evolution (this is why the <i>lie</i> of evolution must be propagated as true in the mainstream). Perhaps this will be the case, perhaps not. Either way, pick up a bible, and trust Jesus Christ with your life today.</p>
    <p>FORGIVE THE SPORADIC NATURE OF THIS SECTION. I HAD TO ADD IT LAST MINUTE. HEED MY WORDS, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, AND LEAN ON CHRIST WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT TODAY.</p>


  <h1>Left Behind?</h1>
  <p>Has there been a sudden catastrophe where certain people disappeared? Make no mistake about what the world tells you - this is a biblical event that occurred, all foretold in the holy scripture of the bible, the book which never lies.</p>
  <p>Buckle up, because it's about to get terrible for the world, and all those that dwell in it.</p>
  <p>Deception will be rampant on the earth, and in order for your soul to conquer, you must be faithful to Jesus Christ like never before.</p>
  <p>You will be a vast minority, most likely.</p>
  <p>But fear not. In the words of Our Lord...</p>
